152,Bucks County firefighter dies of coronavirus,"The assistant fire chief of the Tullytown Fire Company on Saturday became the first Bucks County first responder to die of the coronavirus, county officials said. Bucks County Health Director David Damsker confirmed the death of Rick Johnson, 50, of Tullytown. “Our county has suffered its first loss of a first responder to COVID-19,” county officials said in a Facebook post. “The county commissioners mourn this loss of life and all other that have and will be suffered during the pandemic.” Friends described Johnson as a dedicated volunteer firefighter and active member of his small Bucks County borough of less than 2,000 residents. He had been in the hospital for more than a week, said Aaron Cohen, the fire chief. “It’s been a roller coaster of emotion,” Cohen said. “I’ve known him my whole entire life. He’s the reason I joined the Tullytown fire department.” Johnson was a volunteer firefighter in Tullytown for 27 years; Cohen said he led training for the department and spent about 25 hours per week working with the fire company. » ASK US: Do you have a question about the coronavirus and how it affects your health, work and life? Ask our reporters. Johnson was one of 11 people in Bucks County to die of the coronavirus as of Saturday, when state officials announced that Pennsylvania now has more than 10,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 136 deaths. County officials said Saturday that all county flags would be lowered to half-staff until further notice. Johnson was “a mainstay"" at borough functions, said Tullytown Mayor David Cutchineal. “When you grow up in a small town like Tullytown,” Cutchineal said, “when someone like Rick passes, it’s like a member of your family passes, for all of us.” Johnson’s wife, son, and daughter are also volunteer firefighters. “He was dedicated to the Tullytown Fire Company,” Cutchineal said. “He loved the Philadelphia Eagles, he loved music, he loved to dance.” Cohen said he was not sure how Johnson got infected with the coronavirus. He had not been at the fire company with other people since March 12, and had stopped by alone on March 18. The fire department was professionally cleaned and sanitized even before the fire company knew that Johnson had COVID-19, Cohen said. Fire company members are left to communicate through Facebook and text messages. Still, he said, the virus and the need for social distancing has made it difficult for members of the close-knit company of 50 volunteers to support one another over the painful loss of one of their own. “That’s been the hardest part for us as a family on our end, just not being able to be there for anybody, even him,” Cohen said. “I wouldn’t wish this on anybody.” No memorial events will be planned on behalf of the fire company until the pandemic is over, Cohen said. “He’s well-respected in the fire service in this area and he’s in need of a good showing,” he said. Community members were expected to participate in a drive past the firehouse Saturday night to show support for Johnson’s family, according to a Facebook post shared by the fire company. Some members gathered Friday night outside Jefferson Bucks Hospital in Langhorne, where Johnson had been, to show their love and support. They flashed the lights of the fire trucks and stood holding Johnson’s helmet. Johnson “is currently fighting for his life,” firefighter David Pearl had explained in the video, adding that they all wished they could be inside the hospital with him. “This is the only way we could be in contact with him, and this is what firefighters do — we come out and show our support,” Pearl said. “Whether he can see out the window or not is not important to us. We know that he knows we’re here.” Cohen said the firefighters gathered at the hospital because they heard Friday that Johnson may not make it through the night and they wanted to “go up and pay our last respects.” The fire chief was still “trying to comprehend” Johnson’s death on Saturday afternoon, but said he hoped that it could teach people the importance of social distancing. “I’m hoping that this also hits people that don’t understand about this virus, about what it actually can do and what we have to do as a community. … Wash our hands, the social distancing, stay inside,” he said. “We need to break this curve.” Staff writer Maddie Hanna contributed to this article.

155,How a South Jersey family made a difficult life-ending decision for woman with the coronavirus,"Retired federal worker Shirley B. Jones began feeling ill shortly after returning to Burlington County from a trip to Connecticut in March. Her husband thought she had a cold, possibly the flu, and nursed her at home. Days later, her condition worsened. She was fatigued, coughing uncontrollably, and not eating or drinking. Bruce Jones Sr. summoned an ambulance to their Edgewater Park home and followed by car. At Virtua Memorial Hospital in Mount Holly, Shirley Jones, 70, was taken to the emergency room and later moved to the ICU. Her husband sat in his car, anxiously waiting for answers. Doctors believed she was infected with the coronavirus and began treating her with medications pending test results, said her son, Bruce Jr., 49, of Sicklerville. Eleven days later, on March 31, Shirley Jones died. She was among the 646 victims claimed by the pandemic in New Jersey as of Friday. Her family members described an emotional roller-coaster ride that began around March 18 after she returned from a sorority conference and felt sluggish. Perhaps she was tired from her Amtrak trip from Philadelphia to Hartford, they thought. “You could tell that she was tired,” Bruce said. “But that’s not uncommon. She always stays up late.” Shirley was active in the community and always busy, her son said. She was a substitute teacher two days a week at Edgewater Park Elementary, where she enjoyed working with younger students. She was relatively healthy without any underlying medical conditions, he said. The family believed she would recover with treatment at the hospital. She was given oxygen, which seemed to help. Unable to see her, relatives got regular updates from hospital officials. They suggested a trial drug; doctors said she was already getting it and others. A nurse arranged for the family to speak with her. ”You could tell she was in pain. It sounded scary to me,” said Bruce, an eighth-grade math teacher. He ended the conversation by telling his mother, “I just want to let you know I love you.” He said his mother’s condition deteriorated, and after a week on a ventilator the prognosis was grim. Her doctor asked his father, “What do you want to do?” The family anguished over the decision and decided to stop life support on Tuesday. Jewelle Sutherland, a pulmonologist who considered Shirley like a big sister, volunteered to sit at her bedside because the family could not. She reviewed her chart and reassured the family that they had made the right decision, that there was little chance of recovery. She died minutes after the machines stopped, and Sutherland immediately called to tell the family “it was peaceful.” “I just feel for these families,” said Sutherland, of Virtua Pulmonology. She was not the treating physician. Not getting a chance to say farewell to his mother was heartbreaking, said Bruce, her only child. “I would have liked to have been there for my mom."" Born in Suffolk, Va., Shirley Jones was one of 10 children. She was raised by her paternal grandparents. She met her future husband in high school. He became curious about her after learning they had the same birthday, Oct. 20. ”She was a beautiful person in and out,” he said, choking back tears. The couple married in 1970 and relocated to the Philadelphia region when he accepted a position with a pharmaceutical company. She obtained a bachelor’s degree from Temple University and a master’s from Central Michigan University. She was employed by the Department of Defense in Philadelphia as a program manager and contracting supervisor. She retired in 2010 and later worked at Kingsway Elementary in Haddonfield. “She liked working. She didn’t want to stay home with me,” joked her husband of 49 years, who retired in 1995. She organized an annual cruise for about 20 couples. Known as “Shirley’s cruising group,” they traveled to Alaska, Aruba, France, Jamaica, and Spain. She also was an avid bowler. She was a life member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and served two terms as president of its Willingboro chapter. She was also a member of the LINKS Inc., Rancocas Valley Chapter, and Tabernacle Baptist Church in Burlington, where she served on the Greeters Ministry. “She was one of a kind,” said the Rev. Cory Jones, the church’s pastor. In addition to her husband and son, she is survived by four grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at a later date.

156,"As the coronavirus gains strength in Philly’s jails, panic and fingerpointing mark efforts to avert crisis by thinning inmate population","The push to potentially release thousands of inmates from Pennsylvania’s county jails accelerated Friday as the coronavirus further entrenched itself in detention centers across the state and sparked concern, especially in Philadelphia, of a widespread outbreak behind bars. In response to a lawsuit from the ACLU, the state Supreme Court ordered president judges in every county to begin monitoring efforts to protect prisoners in their jails. If the facilities can’t comply with recommended hygiene and social distancing guidelines, county courts should set up a process to consider certain low-level offenders, pre-trial detainees, and inmates facing the highest risks from infection for potential release, the justices said. But despite reaching an unrelated accord with Philadelphia’s judges on one such protocol Friday, District Attorney Larry Krasner and the city’s chief public defender, Keir Bradford-Grey, expressed frustration that even that process, set to begin next week, won’t thin the jail population fast enough to avert a crisis. “We really need the courts to be more open to considering the direness of the situation,” said Bradford-Grey. “The prison positive tests are growing rapidly day by day. There is no way to social distance in jails and [those numbers are] going to continue to rise. We can’t wait until next Tuesday.” Krasner added: “We want now, and we have wanted all along, to move efficiently with the First Judicial District and all the other stakeholders to make progress.… Sometimes progress in Philly takes a little longer than it should.” Their comments came just hours after the president judges of Philadelphia’s Municipal and Common Pleas Courts outlined the agreement they had cemented with Krasner’s and Bradford-Grey’s offices to expedite inmate release reviews. Starting Tuesday, four courtrooms will be devoted three days a week to considering broad lists of cases on which prosecutors and public defenders can agree. With the Stout Center for Criminal Justice closed for all but emergency hearings, the proceedings will take place over the phone. Prisoners convicted of economic crimes, those who have already completed their minimum sentence, and cases in which bail is less than $25,000 and the inmate has no prior record of violent crime, gun, drug or sex offenses will be fast-tracked. Those criteria could expand as the process moves forward, court officials said. The protocol would not be used to evaluate juvenile cases, which have been undergoing their own process since March 13. It has led to the release of 20 young people from the city’s juvenile detention center. But in a statement accompanying the news, Municipal Court President Judge Patrick Dugan said if anyone was to blame for delays in the process so far, it was Krasner’s office. “For weeks the courts have sought from the District Attorney’s Office an agreed-upon list of individuals whose cases were deemed sufficiently appropriate for review and possible release, as well as an agreed-upon method and criteria by which to conduct the reviews,” he said, adding that the courts have still not received those lists. Krasner said prosecutors supplied lists of 1,197 candidates for likely release some time ago. That claim drew another retort from the courts. “With all due respect, the courts have been waiting some three weeks for the DA’s Office to provide a list of specific individuals to review and determine if immediate release is warranted,"" said Gabe Roberts, spokesperson for the First Judicial District. ""It should be noted that at any point during these past three weeks, if the court had received such a list, it would have started a review process immediately.” That level of finger-pointing has characterized much of the discussion surrounding what stakeholders have described as a public health emergency unfolding behind bars, according to participants on all sides of the negotiations. Advocates have been warning for weeks that the nation’s detention centers — with their cramped conditions, shared cells, limited hygiene, and inability to follow recommended social distancing guidelines — threaten to become a tinderbox for transmission that could put inmates, corrections officers, and the surrounding community at risk. In New York City, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, more than 450 inmates and guards at Rikers Island have tested positive for the virus — an infection rate more than seven times the general population’s. And as of Friday, 31 prisoners in Philadelphia’s jails and an unspecified number of guards had fallen ill with the COVID-19 disease, city officials said — a rate of infection that outpaces the city’s more than four times over. A week ago, only one inmate and one guard had tested positive for the virus. Philadelphia’s judges, prosecutors and public defenders began discussing a process to review the cases of low-level offenders and those most at risk from an infection at the beginning of March — well before the state Supreme Court closed all courthouses to the public in a bid to prevent them from becoming vectors for the disease. And yet, it was only last week that the three parties reached a vaguely outlined agreement to begin reviewing cases for potentially releasable inmates. Thus far, the District Attorney’s Office and the Defender Association have submitted to the courts more than 300 motions seeking the release of low-level offenders, including some held on technical probation violations such as missing a meeting with their probation officer. Many others have already completed their minimum jail sentence and would have been eligible for parole hearings if the court were open. But they have had to do so through a time-consuming, case-by-case process instead of submitting a broad list of potentially releasable candidates for the court’s review, said Bradford-Grey. As of Friday, the population of the Philadelphia jails was only about 7% lower than two weeks earlier. Surrounding jails like those in Bucks and Delaware Counties have shaved their inmate counts by 20% and 35% percent respectively through a similar process of review, according to statistics provided by the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. “These are people that would be out if the courts were functional,” Bradford-Grey said. “If some people don’t get out of that prison soon, they’re not going to be able to come out because they are in quarantine.” Meanwhile, the tension level within quarantine blocks in the city’s jails boiled over Friday afternoon. Just after 2 p.m., nine quarantined inmates at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center on State Road began throwing commissary containers at the windows of their cells in an effort to break the glass, according to two corrections officers who were not authorized to discuss the incident publicly. Guards in riot gear and using pepper spray were called to extract those causing the disturbance, the officers said. No inmates or staff were injured, city officials said. Managing Director Brian Abernathy said the jails have adopted new measures to address both security and health concerns. Inmates have now been provided with masks and are being kept “sheltered in place” in their cells, allowed out only to shower and use the phones. “We know advocates for all of those housed in congregate settings are worried, but the fact is we are going to great lengths to keep everyone safe,” he said. “Participants and staff alike.” Staff writers Laura McCrystal, Lisa Gartner, Barbara Laker, and Samantha Melamed contributed to this article.

157,"Coronavirus change: Independence, Horizon to cover all cost of inpatient care for COVID-19","Independence Blue Cross and Horizon, the largest insurers in the Philadelphia area and in New Jersey, have eliminated cost-sharing — co-payments, deductibles, and other out-of-pocket costs for consumers — for COVID-19 inpatient hospital treatment, joining some of their national competitors in going that route. For Independence customers, the changes are effective retroactively to March 30 and extend through May 31. Horizon made its changes retroactive to March 1 and effective through at least June 30. New Jersey so far has been much harder hit by coronavirus infections than Pennsylvania. The policy change does not automatically apply to individuals who have coverage through employers who pay health-care costs without buying insurance. Those employers can opt out of the change. Horizon specified that the change also applies to Medicare and Medicaid. The insurer, based in Newark, said that plans covering state employees and school employees had already agreed to the change. In all, the change affects 2.4 million Horizon customers, a Horizon spokesperson said. Independence did not say how many of its customers the change would affect.

158,Will homemade masks stop coronavirus from spreading? Fact-checking Sen. Pat Toomey’s claim | PolitiFact,"Last weekend, Sen. Pat Toomey recorded a message about how to stop the spread of the coronavirus and posted it on Twitter. His message was simple and direct — start wearing a homemade mask when you leave the house. “My mask will keep someone else safe and their mask will keep me safe,” said Toomey, a Republican from the Lehigh Valley. “I’m not suggesting this is any kind of guarantee. It probably doesn’t have tremendous value for the person wearing the mask but it probably does significantly reduce the risk that people could inadvertently transmit it.” Since masks for health-care workers are in such short supply, we wondered whether Toomey’s assertion is true. For weeks, public health officials advised healthy Americans not to wear masks. But on Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the guidance had changed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging everyone to wear homemade cloth masks when they leave the house, just as Toomey called for a week ago. He was the first member of Congress to advocate for the shift. But even as Trump announced the new advisory, he said he didn’t plan to follow it himself. “It’s voluntary, so you don’t have to do it,” Trump said at Friday’s daily coronavirus briefing. “They suggest it for a period of time. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.” Trump said the guidance shifted because research indicates that people who are infected with the coronavirus but aren’t showing any symptoms can still transmit the disease. He also reiterated that wearing homemade masks is not a replacement for other strategies such as social distancing and hand-washing. “We want to make sure everybody understands it’s not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out,” Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said Thursday. Toomey got another thing right. Homemade masks are significantly more effective at preventing asymptomatic carriers of the virus from accidentally spreading it than they are at shielding a healthy person from contracting it. And the efficacy of any homemade mask depends on how it’s made. The most effective homemade masks are made of thick cloth and make a tight seal around the wearer’s face. ""Given the current crisis, and lacking an alternative, many layers of densely woven fabric would be the most effective, because it allows for lots of voids in the layers where particles can be trapped,"" Richard Peltier, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, told us by email. ""The mask needs to seal as tightly as possible to the face to avoid leaks, though this may not be possible with different designs, fabrics, or face shapes. Thin or porous fabrics are the least likely to be effective."" A study published in October 2010 tested how cloth masks and common fabrics fared when sprayed with aerosols at different speeds. All of the materials performed worse than hospital-grade N95 respirators. But some, such as cotton towels and scarves, were in the range of some surgical masks. The authors cautioned that fabric materials ""show only marginal filtration performance against virus-size particles when sealed around the edges."" A study from 2013 found that cotton masks perform only about half as well as surgical masks and “should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals.” More recent research had similar results. So at best, using thick or layered fabric to make a homemade mask could be as effective as using some surgical masks. At worst, it prevents at least some of your respiratory droplets from spreading to others while in public. Under ideal circumstances, no face masks are intended to be worn for more than one encounter. That guidance also extends to homemade masks. “At the end of the day, these cloth masks should be treated as contaminated materials that you bring in to your home — they need to be laundered in hot soapy water, and you’d need to consider sanitizing in bleach or hydrogen peroxide regularly,” Peltier said.

159,"Limerick nuclear plant worker tests positive, raising coronavirus fears during refueling outage","One of about 1,400 contract workers involved with the refueling outage at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Montgomery County has tested positive for COVID-19, which is likely to further raise concerns of local officials who have protested Exelon Generation’s decision to proceed with the annual maintenance event. Exelon notified county health officials that a contract worker at the Limerick Generating Station tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday night. The worker, who is from central Pennsylvania, was last on site on Monday. The areas that the worker used have been decontaminated and plant employees were notified, the company said in a statement. Two other full-time Limerick workers were diagnosed recently with COVID-19 at the plant, but they have not been on site since March 20, Lacy Dean, director of communications for Exelon Generation, said in a statement. The refueling outage, which involves the influx of about 1,400 workers, began on March 27. “The health and safety of our employees and contractors, and limiting the spread of the virus, are our utmost priorities, and we have strict protocols in place to address each case as it occurs,” the company said in a statement Friday. “Any employees who came in close contact with the affected persons or work at that reporting location are notified, and we perform an additional deep cleaning of all areas that have potentially been exposed.” Of the 1,400 workers, Exelon said about half are local and half come from out of state. But nobody who has traveled recently overseas, or is coming in from hard-hit New York City, is permitted to work on site. News of the infected worker is likely to heighten concern among Montgomery County officials, who have raised protests in recent days about Exelon’s decision to proceed with the refueling of one of its two Limerick reactors. County Commissioner Val Arkoosh said at a news conference Friday that county officials have had discussions with Exelon after she expressed concern this week that the influx of workers might jeopardize the county’s efforts to combat the pandemic. » ASK US: Do you have a question about the coronavirus and how it affects your health, work and life? Ask our reporters. “We are in communication with them on a daily basis, and our office of public health is working to establish a routine set of data for them to share with us every day,” she said. “They are giving us guidance on what data they are collecting.” Arkoosh did not mention the newly diagnosed worker. U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat from Montgomery County, also expressed concern on Thursday. “While I recognize the nuclear plant as a vital part of our infrastructure, we must ensure that proper measures are taken to keep both the workers and our community safe — and limit the spread of COVID-19 as much as possible,” Dean said in a statement Thursday. Some officials and anti-nuclear activists had suggested that Exelon should postpone the refueling event, in which a third of the nuclear fuel in Unit 1 is replaced. “We just do not have that luxury,” Dave Marcheskie, Limerick’s communications manager, said in a video that the company posted on Thursday. Exelon officials said the refueling is required to keep the 2,260-megawatt complex operating at capacity in the summer, when its power is in peak demand. The Department of Energy and Gov. Tom Wolf have designated power-generation plants as essential “life-sustaining” businesses that are permitted to remain open and conduct maintenance during the public health emergency. Dan Brouillette, the U.S. energy secretary, reached out on March 27 to Wolf to specifically ensure the Limerick refueling was not delayed.  Limerick is one of more than 30 reactors nationwide that are scheduled for refueling and maintenance outages this spring, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. Nuclear operators typically schedule outages for either spring or fall, when electricity demand subsides between the heating and air-conditioning seasons, and the workhorse power plants can be taken offline without risk to the power grid. In addition to Limerick, spring refueling outages are also scheduled or underway at operators of the Beaver Valley Power Station in Shippingport, Pa., the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Berwick, Pa., and the Salem Nuclear Power Plant in Lower Alloways Creek Township, N.J. Refueling outages are planned a year in advance — tools, experts, and nuclear fuel are ordered, and work schedules are choreographed to reduce the time the plants are offline during maintenance. Nuclear power plants typically operate nearly all year, providing a constant source of electricity to the grid. Each Limerick unit powers about one million homes. As the start date for the Limerick outage approached amid the coronavirus outbreak, the company postponed nonessential maintenance tasks it had scheduled to reduce the workforce by more than 300 people, said Lacey Dean. The outage was also extended by two days to reduce the density of workers in the plant. » READ MORE: Coronavirus math shows the importance of social distancing, and the horrible consequences of not doing it Dean said in a statement that Limerick had strict procedures in place to keep the public, employees and contractors safe, including the use of social distancing. “As part of Limerick’s comprehensive COVID-19 safety precautions, all workers must pass a symptom screening and body temperature check prior to entry every shift,” she said. “We’re also requiring social distancing, remote work where possible, frequent hand washing, and increased facility cleaning and disinfection.” Staff writers Allison Steele and Vinny Vella contributed to this article.

160,"Assume coronavirus is already there, says a Philly nursing home doctor who learned the hard way","Back in March, Joshua Uy, a Penn Medicine geriatrician who is also the top doctor at a West Philadelphia nursing home, thought he was ahead of the curve in protecting the facility’s residents from a new virus that had raged through a nursing home in Washington state. He and his administrator, Sunil Chacko, restricted visits, stopped group activities, and didn’t let outside vendors or transport workers go beyond the lobby of Renaissance Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center. Staff members were tested for fever before shifts and asked about symptoms. “We thought we were doing everything that Kirkland hadn’t done,” said Uy, referring to Life Care Center of Kirkland, the facility tied to 40 deaths of residents and visitors and 129 coronavirus infections. Eight days later, on March 19, Renaissance became Philadelphia’s first nursing home with a positive case. Four residents have since died, and as of mid-week, 22 residents and a contract employee who provided therapy and last worked at the nursing home on March 11 had tested positive. All of the infected residents lived in a 30-bed unit for long-term residents. Uy has known some of them for a decade. He’s met their children and grandchildren. “It’s the patients we know the best,” he said. He was on quarantine himself for what turned out to be a cold when the first case was discovered in a hospitalized patient who later died. He immediately called West Coast medical directors who already had experience with the disease and was soon cleared to return to work. “It was easily the hardest week of my professional career,"" he said. ""I have never dealt with an infection like this before. It feels like a professional failure when you’ve put so much effort into keeping the virus out, and it gets in anyway.” Now, two weeks into personally battling coronavirus, he has developed a powerful respect — and fear — for this tiny new enemy. He estimates that over the past week, he has talked with almost 50 other medical directors to share what he’s learned. “The best advice is coming from word of mouth,” Uy said. “This is changing so fast.” He tells his fellow doctors they have days, at most a week, to get their acts together. The “terrible asymptomatic spread” of coronavirus — some experts now think that most cases have no symptoms — makes it exceptionally difficult to defend against. According to state health departments, 132 of New Jersey’s 375 nursing homes had at least one coronavirus case, and 79 residents had died as of Friday. Meanwhile, 92 of Pennsylvania’s 695 nursing homes had reported a total of 200 confirmed cases as of mid-week. Pennsylvania is not reporting nursing-home deaths. Because of nursing home residents’ advanced age and poor physical health, they are especially vulnerable to the new virus. Nursing homes, Uy said, are used to trying to keep viruses like the flu out. Tough containment measures, such as blocking visitors and stopping activities, usually don’t start until after the first, or “index,"" case, in part because “everything about a nursing home is designed to be social.” That’s too late for this virus, he said. In fact, starting a week or two before the first case may be too late because of the two-week incubation period. “Once you wait for that index case, there’s probably 10 or more in the building,” Uy said. After he knew Renaissance had a case, he had to make the “hard emotional pivot” from putting all of his energy into keeping the coronavirus out to working like crazy to keep it from spreading. He’s begging his fellow nursing home medical directors to make that strategic change now. “If their only plan is to keep it out, they’re unprepared,” he said. “The best way to keep it out is to assume it’s already in the building. … Whatever you think you’re going to do once it’s in your building, start doing it now … because the virus doesn’t play nice. You have to get ahead of it.” Uy doesn’t know how the coronavirus penetrated Renaissance. The most likely sources were staff members or patients who go out for dialysis three times a week. Dialysis patients have become infected in other locations, Uy said, and some of his patients have had symptoms. “I think it’s an entry point that people have to think about,” he said. Dialysis centers now treat all Renaissance patients as if they were infected, he said. In the week before the first case, there had been no new admissions, which are also a potential source of infection. Uy advises nursing home leaders to soak up as much advice and help from others as possible. Workers from Philadelphia’s Department of Public Health very quickly did widespread testing at Renaissance. Uy learned what doctors in Washington and California had done and asked his colleagues at Penn and two other physicians at Renaissance for help in developing treatment protocols. He began asking patients and their relatives how they would feel about spending two weeks on a ventilator, a common fate for those who suffer the most severe coronavirus symptoms. Within a couple days, he insisted that every staffer wear masks and face shields at all times in the building. Uy said that Renaissance, unlike many nursing homes, has enough protective equipment. The nursing home’s owner made sure there was a respiratory therapist in the building. Some hospice programs have not been working directly with patients who have COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, so Uy talked with Penn’s hospice program about supporting grieving family members. That, he said, has “made a huge difference.” So far, there have been no positive cases outside of the initial wing. “I don’t rest easy about that, though,” he said. “I just don’t trust this virus.” » HELP US REPORT: Are you a health care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker or other expert?

Though this may seem like an extremely long time to all of us who are not scientists, my colleague Tom Avril reports that 18 months would actually be the fastest development of a vaccine yet. It usually takes years, even decades, to design a vaccine, prove that it’s safe and that it works and, create a manufacturing facility to mass produce the vaccine. And a vaccine isn’t the only thing the medical community is racing for. An intensive care doctor wrote for The Inquirer about desperately needing more vital medical technology such as ventilators.

249,"Donald J. Horsfall, a consultant whose quiet life was shattered by a fall and the coronavirus, dies at 72","Donald J. Horsfall, 72, of Rydal, a computer consultant who led a quiet life with his wife, Carol Ann Casciato, in their house with an English garden, died Sunday, March 22, at Abington Hospital-Jefferson Health. Mr. Horsfall and his wife were the owners of International Technical Communications Inc., a computer consulting business based in their home. She was the vice president, he the president. They coauthored nine books about computing and served a variety of clients. Other than that, they hung out at their calm retreat in the suburbs and loved each other for 52 years. They were planning to retire next year and move to an apartment in a senior community. “He played computer games and worked for his company and with me,” his wife said. “We truly were soul mates. We lived together, worked together, liked each other, and spoiled each other. I cooked. Neither of us was a social butterfly. We had a few very close friends. “He didn’t try to change me, and I didn’t try to change him,” she said. But their peaceful life was shattered on March 15, when Mr. Horsfall lost his balance while climbing some stairs and fell backward onto a tile floor. “The next thing I know, boom! It was a stupid accident,” his wife said. “His head hit the floor."" He was hospitalized, but seemed to be doing better by Wednesday, she said. Then he got the coronavirus. “I really don’t know how — there’s no direct line that we can figure out. There’s no way we can see that he could have contacted anyone who had the virus,” she said. To keep the virus from spreading, the hospital enforced a quarantine, keeping visitors away. By Saturday, doctors removed the ventilator and tubes, and, knowing that Mr. Horsfall didn’t have long to live, summoned his wife. “They suited me up and let me sit with him,” his wife said. “I could talk to him and hold his hand for an hour and a half. At least he could see me and know me.” When the end came the next morning, Mr. Horsfall drifted off to sleep under palliative care. Medical staff said his death was peaceful, but his wife remains saddened that she couldn’t be there. “It’s hard to tell you how horrible this is. I would have been there, talking to him, holding his hand the whole time,” she said. The Montgomery County Coroner’s Office said Mr. Horsfall died of the coronavirus. The secondary cause of death was complications from the fall. He was the first patient to die of the virus in Montgomery County. Mr. Horsfall’s wife is now in quarantine at home. Born in Norristown in 1948, Mr. Horsfall graduated from Eisenhower High School in 1965 and was awarded a scholarship to Drexel University, where he met his wife. Both were science majors, he in chemistry, she in physics. He decided not to become a chemist because “they don’t live long,” he told her. So, they set up their consulting business. Although a couple for decades, they only married in 2000. When not working, Mr. Horsfall loved to read science books and science fiction. He was generous to a fault. When the couple’s friends needed help moving into a new house, he was glad to help. He liked to spoil his nieces. “He was a real good person who didn’t deserve to have this happen to him,” his wife said. “He was gentle and a true gentleman, and will be sorely missed.” Besides his wife, Mr. Horsfall is survived by a sister and three nieces.

161,Coronavirus cartoon: We lost the fight against our phones and screens,"Remember when we all cared about limiting our screen time? With all of us trapped in our homes due to the continued spread of the coronavirus, the time we spend on our electronic gadgets is surging. In my own personal experience, I spend all day clacking away on my computer at work, spend a few hours playing with my kids, then dive into some type of movie or show with my exhausted wife while we both check news headlines on our phone. Only masochists are opening their screen time apps. It’s even worse for kids, who are out of school and being told to stay six feet away from the small number of friends they’re allowed to see at any one time. According to new data from SuperAwesome, a kids technology company, children between the ages of six and 12 are spending at least 50% more time in front of screens on a daily basis. “I’ve accessed every educational app you can. I’ve used every online interactive worksheet I can find,” Daniela Helitzer, a doctor of audiology in Boca Raton, Fla., told the New York Times. “If he’s sitting on his iPad for two or three hours a day, I literally don’t even care. It’s like, ‘Use that screen as much as you can.’” My hope is by the time we get COVID-19 under control, we’ll all come out the other side sick of our gadgets and with a newfound desire to spend our times out and about with friends and family.

That digital divide, which disproportionately affects poor and predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods, has become an urgent issue as the pandemic forces many to study or work from their homes. — Christian Hetrick, Dylan Purcell // Timestamp 04/03 7:05pm Inmates confined to quarantine in a Philadelphia jail created a disturbance Friday as concern over a coronavirus outbreak in the city’s detention centers spread. Nine quarantined prisoners at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center on State Road began throwing storage bins just after 2 p.m. in an attempt to break the glass on their cell doors, according to sources who were not authorized to discuss the incident publicly. Guards in riot gear extracted those causing the disturbance using minimal pepper spray. A spokesman for the city said no injuries to inmates or staff were reported. As of Friday, 31 inmates and an unspecified number of guards had tested positive for the coronavirus – a week after the city confirmed its first positive prisoner case. The city has not specified how many prisoners have been quarantined for suspected infection. All of the city’s jails are now following a “shelter-in-place” policy for their population of roughly 4,400 inmates and are allowed out of their cells only to shower and use the telephone, city Managing Director Brian Abernathy said. “We know advocates for all of those housed in congregate settings are worried, but the fact is we are going to great lengths to keep everyone safe – participants and staff alike,” he said. — Jeremy Roebuck, Samantha Melamed, Laura McCrystal // Timestamp 04/03 6:41pm Mural Arts Philadelphia hired artists to design spacing decals that encourage grocery customers to stand at least six feet apart, for the Space Pad Project. On Friday, they installed the decals in four checkout lanes at the ShopRite on on West Oregon Avenue in South Philadelphia, with plans to return next week for more. Kate Jacobi, the project manager from Mural Arts Philadelphia, described the project as a “triple win"": The organization was able to hire artists, participate in safe distancing messaging, and provide something uplifting. — Monica Herndon // Timestamp 04/03 6:06pm Penn Medicine announced Friday that it is establishing a COVID-19 Immunology Defense Fund with a $1 million donation from Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie. The money will go toward an emerging research program to test endangered health care workers for potential immunity to COVID-19 as well as research toward a treatment and an eventual vaccine, according to a press release from Penn Medicine. “We are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis that is affecting all of us in so many ways,” Lurie said in a statement. “Every passing day brings new stories of heartbreaking tragedy, inspirational courage, and hopeful innovation.” — Les Bowen // Timestamp 04/03 6:04pm President Donald Trump announced Friday that the Centers for Disease Control now recommends people wear non-medical cloth face coverings as a voluntary measure to defend against the transmission of COVID-19. At the daily White House briefing, Trump emphasized wearing the covering is voluntary. “You can do it. You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it,” Trump said. “It’s only a recommendation.” “I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical masks,” he said. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the CDC’s decision to change its recommendation was based on new research that shows a significant portion of people carrying the coronavirus lack symptoms. Adams said the cloth face coverings should be used in public settings where social distancing measures are tough to maintain, like grocery stores and pharmacies, but emphasized maintaining six feet of distancing is “key to preventing the virus’ spread.” Trump also said that a few health insurance companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, will not require co-payments for people undergoing coronavirus treatment in the next 60 days. Additionally, he said uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government. “This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans have about seeking coronavirus treatment,” he said. Alex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services, said the funding would come from a portion of the $100 billion built into the CARES Act for health insurance providers, which will be reimbursed at Medicare rates. — Ellie Rushing // Timestamp 04/03 5:45pm As the death toll of the coronavirus continues to tick higher across Pennsylvania and New Jersey Friday, Gov. Tom Wolf urged everyone in the commonwealth to wear a cloth face mask while in public, and U.S. officials are expected to soon recommend the same. On Friday afternoon, New Jersey remained one of the nation’s most hard-hit states by the coronavirus, second only to New York, reporting 29,895 positive patients, and 646 total deaths. Calling the pandemic “one of the greatest tragedies to ever hit our state,” Gov. Phil Murphy ordered the Garden State’s flags at half mast Friday in honor of every resident to die from the virus. As of Friday, Pennsylvania has reported at least 102 deaths and 8,420 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, occurring in 63 of the state’s 67 counties. In Philadelphia, 26 people have now died from the virus, as officials announced nine new deaths Friday. Half of the deceased lived in nursing homes, officials said. In total, the city has reported 2,430 confirmed cases of the virus. Help is on the way in Montgomery County, the epicenter of Pennsylvania’s coronavirus outbreak, where a 500-member outfit of medical care providers and volunteers will arrive Sunday to boost the county’s “surge capacity” as available hospital beds continue to dwindle. Meanwhile, Philadelphia will move its recycling pick-up to a temporary biweekly schedule to compensate for a staffing shortage, while the courts are set to speed up their review of inmates for potential release to prevent further spread of the virus. And due to economic fallout from the virus, Pennsylvania will stop paying 9,000 state workers, and hospitals are furloughing employees as revenues decline. — Oona Goodin-Smith, Pranshu Verma, Erin McCarthy, Vinny Vella // Timestamp 04/03 5:29pm SEPTA is getting $643 million in federal stimulus relief to help stem the losses from the coronavirus. The funds are expected to be used over the next 12 to 18 months, said spokesperson Andrew Busch. SEPTA projects at least a $300 million loss to revenue from now through the end of June 2021. The transportation authority is also bracing for at least a $250 million hit to subsidies, with the remaining $93 million to help supplement further losses. SEPTA’s executive team, including General Manager Leslie Richards, has taken an additional 5% pay cut on top of a 10% reduction announced last month, while 669 managers and administrators also took a 10% pay reduction. The SEPTA funds are part of Pennsylvania’s $1.13 billion in new transit funding through the CARES Act, Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) announced Friday. — Patricia Madej // Timestamp 04/03 5:21pm Police in Delaware have a warning to Pennsylvania residents looking to make an alcohol run: Don’t cross the border to buy booze or for other nonessential reasons. At Total Wine & More in Claymont, just south of the Pennsylvania border, police on Friday were turning away customers from Pennsylvania, where liquor stores remain closed and online sales have been plagued with problems due to “overwhelming demand.” Many would-be customers seemed unaware of travel restrictions put in place by Gov. John Carney this week, which prohibit out-of-state drivers from entering Delaware unless they work for an essential business, caring for a family member, or there are health-care reasons. To enforce the restrictions, Delaware state police have been authorized to stop out-of-state drivers on state and local roads simply because they don’t have Delaware tags. Residents from Pennsylvania and elsewhere who don’t have a good reason to be in the state are being instructed to return home and self-quarantine for 14 days. Some Pennsylvania customers were also turned away from a Home Depot by Delaware state police on Friday. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 04/03 4:30pm The University of the Sciences in Philadelphia has donated 70,000 pieces of protective equipment including gloves, masks and suits to the city’s emergency management office to be distributed to healthcare workers battling the coronavirus pandemic. University faculty and staff gathered the items from campus laboratories, facilities and classrooms, the university said. The donations included 230 N95 masks, 100 surgical procedure masks, 300 protective booties, 125 “Tyvek” protective suits, 132 pairs of safety glasses and more than 68,000 “nitrile” gloves. — Susan Snyder // Timestamp 04/03 3:52pm Officials in Montgomery County announced Friday that they have a new tool in the efforts to combat COVID-19. A Specialized Medical Assistance and Response Team of 500 medical-care providers and volunteers will be arriving in the county on Sunday, according to County Commissioner Valerie Arkoosh. The team and its facility will help boost the county’s “surge capacity” as available hospital beds continue to dwindle. Arkoosh stressed that the county does still have open beds, but that “every day, those beds get a little fewer.” “Our goal, with our first responders, is to get through this with availability for everyone,” she said. An additional 71 residents of the county tested positive for coronavirus Friday, according to health department officials. With that, the county has a total of 778 cases. Included in those 71 cases were three fatalities: an 87-year-old woman from Upper Gwynedd Township, a 94 year-old-woman from Springfield Township and a 73-year-old man from Abington Township. All three died in hospitals, Arkoosh said. Echoing what Gov. Tom Wolf said earlier in the day, Arkoosh, who is a physician with a background in public health, implored residents to stay home, and encouraged them to wear masks and to “take a step back” if they encounter friends or family members while out. — Vinny Vella // Timestamp 04/03 3:46pm The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Friday directed judges statewide to monitor their county jails’ efforts to protect inmates from the coronavirus and, if necessary, intervene to set up a process for releasing prisoners from facilities that can’t comply with recommended social distancing and hygiene guidelines. The order came in response to an emergency petition earlier in the week filed by the ACLU on behalf of five inmates, who said it was only a matter of time before the virus overruns the tightly cramped jails they were housed in. The court’s justices stopped short of ordering the categorical release of all nonviolent offenders, those being held for minor probation violations and those unable to cover the costs of cash bail – as the ACLU had originally requested. Such an approach, they said in their order, “fails to take into account the potential danger of inmates to victims and the general population, as well as the diversity of situations present within individual institutions and communities, which vary dramatically in size and population density.” The decision came the same day that Philadelphia’s Municipal Court and Common Pleas judges reached an accord with the District Attorney’s Office and the Defenders Association to fast-track the review of some low-level offenders for possible release amid rising numbers of positive coronavirus tests in the city’s jails. — Jeremy Roebuck // Timestamp 04/03 3:19pm When the coronavirus first began spreading in Philadelphia, it primarily was detected among white people, the limited data available to the city indicate. But over time, the demographics shifted, and most new cases are predominantly in African-Americans, raising fears that existing inequalities in the city will be exacerbated by the public health crisis. “Predominantly Caucasians were infected before, and now we’re seeing a predominance of African-Americans,” Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said at a news conference this week. “This virus does not discriminate. The virus is in every neighborhood. It’s in every population. Everyone needs to take our recommendations seriously to avoid getting the infection or passing on the infection.” The emerging trend in Philly tracks with patterns in other U.S. cities and deepens experts’ fears of a scenario that has played out in past epidemics, in which a virus spread around the globe by those with the means to travel comes down hardest on the most vulnerable communities. — Sean Collins Walsh // Timestamp 04/03 2:59pm Alcohol purchases in March spiked dramatically with the spread of coronavirus, which prompted the shutdown of Pennsylvania’s state-run liquor stores. The Liquor Control Board on Friday reported selling almost a month’s worth of wine and spirits in only 17 days. The $29.9 million sold on March 16 — the day before the Fine Wine and Good Spirits stores were closed — was the most spent on booze in Pennsylvania in one day, according to complete sales records dating back 12 years. March 2020 sales of wine and spirits totaled $198.1 million, off 2% compared with March 2019 sales. Sales after March 17 were made through state-operated warehouses serving restaurants and grocery stores, which operate Monday to Friday and are not subject to the closing. — Michael Klein // Timestamp 04/03 2:30pm As New Jersey’s death toll ticked higher, Gov. Phil Murphy ordered state flags lowered to half mast immediately and indefinitely to honor every New Jerseyan that has died from the pandemic. ""This is one of the greatest tragedies to ever hit our state,” Murphy said Friday. “Since families at this time can not even hold funerals for their loved ones, this is a small … important way to show their loss is not forgotten.” Murphy noted the pace of the state’s coronavirus pandemic may be a “week-ish behind New York,” after having conversations with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Health. The Empire State has been ravaged more than any other in the nation by the disease and now has over 100,000 positive cases and 2,935 dead. New Jersey comes in second with 29,895 positive patients, and 646 total deaths as of Friday. Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli noted 4,372 more people have tested positive for the disease, with another 113 people dying overnight. She also said 3,016 Garden State residents are hospitalized due to the coronavirus, with 1,227 on ventilators. At least 132 of the state’s 375 long term care facilities have a positive coronavirus patient under their care. Another three long term care residents have also died, bringing the statewide toll for the vulnerable population to 79. The governor noted the state has 42 testing sites up across the state, and shot back at critics who said the state did not do enough to get people tested in the early stages of the pandemic. “We have made a cold blooded decision overwhelmingly to test, with limited supplies, symptomatic persons,” Murphy said. Economic officials also noted 16,500 small businesses have already applied to a statewide program that would provide relief for businesses struggling due to the coronavirus pandemic. — Pranshu Verma // Timestamp 04/03 2:22pm As Pennsylvania continues to see an increasing number of coronavirus cases each day, Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday urged all residents to wear a cloth mask when they must leave home, a recommendation that he said will be in line with forthcoming guidance from the CDC. But on a day that the state recorded 1,404 new cases, Wolf stressed that these new measures should not provide a false sense of safety. “Masks help prevent people from sharing illnesses,” Wolf said. “They don’t do a great job at preventing people from getting sick and they’re not foolproof, so it’s critical that our first act … is to ask ourselves whether we really need to leave our house.” Wolf and Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said laypeople should not wear paper surgical masks or N95 masks, as these types of protective equipment should be reserved for essential workers on the front lines of the pandemic. Instead, they urged people to make their own masks or find individuals or businesses in their area who were making them. “Wearing a mask or even a bandana could be an extra layer of protection,” Levine said. “Remember a mask isn’t a pass to go back to work or visit friends or socialize.” Wolf said the CDC would soon recommend “universal masking,” but “we want to be ahead of the nation in stopping the spread of COVID-19.” As of Friday, Pennsylvania reported at least 8,420 cases of the coronavirus, spanning 63 of the state’s 67 counties. Of that number, 102 people have died, 852 people have been hospitalized, 241 people have required intensive care, and 147 have required ventilators. Across the commonwealth, 419 healthcare workers have tested positive for the virus, and at least 83 of the state’s 695 licensed nursing homes have recorded at least one case. — Erin McCarthy // Timestamp 04/03 2:02pm Layoffs are surging nationally to unprecedented numbers, and even workers in the health care industry — especially those who don’t provide clinical care — are not immune as the COVID-19 pandemic upends the medical system. Among the non-clinical workers at risk are those at the Trinity Health’s Mid-Atlantic System, which operates five hospitals in the southeast Pennsylvania suburbs and has announced an intention to furlough staff. Shore Medical Center in Somers Point, N.J., asked non-clinical workers to volunteer for layoffs. Bayada Home Health Care of Plymouth Meeting is temporarily furloughing 3% of its work force, all people in administrative and managerial roles, even as it seeks to hire clinical care personnel, a spokesperson said. Others involved in non-emergency patient care are being asked to dip into their vacation time rather than come to work, or they are being scheduled for fewer hours — meaning smaller paychecks. The common denominator: So many non-emergency procedures and surgeries have been placed on hold to prepare for the expected surge in COVID-19 patients, hospital systems don’t need the workforce they required just weeks ago, and they don’t have the revenue. — Ellie Rushing, Jason Laughlin // Timestamp 04/03 1:50pm Delaware Gov. John Carney said the number of cases of COVID-19 will be “well over” 400 when the state updates its numbers later today, quadruple the number the state reported last week. “The situation in Delaware is getting worse,” Carney said bluntly, pointing out the state is seeing a daily growth in cases of 15 to 20%. As of Friday, 12 people have died in Delaware, with half of the state’s deaths associated with long-term care facilities. Carney said there are about 100 people currently hospitalized, but showed state projections that expect upwards of 1,000 people needing simultaneous hospital care as coronavirus cases spike in the next 10 to 14 days. Delaware Emergency Management manager A.J. Schall said Delaware has submitted emergency declaration request to the federal government to get additional aid. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 04/03 1:41pm The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas will begin expediting its review of inmates for potential release next week under a protocol agreed upon by judges, the District Attorney’s Office and the Defender Association amid a coronavirus outbreak in the county’s jails, court officials said Friday. Prisoners convicted of economic crimes, those who have already completed their minimum sentence and cases where bail is less than $25,000 and the inmate has no prior sex, violent crime, gun or drug offenses will be fast-tracked. Four courtrooms will be devoted three days a week to telephonic hearings on cases vetted by both prosecutors and public defenders. The plan comes more than a week after stakeholders agreed on a general process to begin reviewing potentially hundreds of motions for release out of concern that the close quarters, shared cells and inability to practice social distancing could make the county’s jails a tinderbox for viral transmission. But as days passed, inmate advocates questioned whether the process was moving too slowly to make a difference. “For weeks the courts have sought from the District Attorney’s Office an agreed upon list of individuals whose cases were deemed sufficiently appropriate for review and possible release, as well as an agreed upon method and criteria by which to conduct the reviews,” Municipal Court President Judge Patrick Dugan said in a statement. “While the courts continue to await a list of specific cases for review, we are encouraged that all parties are moving in the right direction.” Managing Director Brian Abernathy said all inmates will be sheltered in place, provided with masks, and only permitted out of their cells for phone calls and showers in order to limit the spread of the virus. Food and medications will be delivered to them in their cells. — Jeremy Roebuck, Laura McCrystal // Timestamp 04/03 1:38pm A total of 26 Philadelphians have now died of the coronavirus. Health Commissioner Thomas Farley announced nine new deaths Friday. Half of the residents who have died of the virus lived in nursing homes, Farley said. One patient was in their 40s, two in their 50s, two in their 60s, 11 in their 70s, seven in their 80s, and three were over age 90. The city now has a total of 2,430 confirmed cases of the virus, Farley said. The increase in 330 cases announced Friday represented a decrease from the number of new cases confirmed Thursday, but Farley warned against reading into that decrease. “We want to follow the long term trends, not so much the day-to-day changes,"" he said. Farley said there are now 356 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Philadelphia, and 656 hospitalized in all of Southeastern Pennsylvania. Some of those patients are not local to the area, he said. Farley has said he expects patients to continue coming from the New York area, which has more cases of the virus. “Some people, I think, want us to build a wall between New York City and Philadelphia and we’re not going to do that,"" Farley said. “We may not like those New York City sports teams but the people in New York deserve medical care as well.” — Laura McCrystal // Timestamp 04/03 1:25pm Philadelphia will begin collecting recycling every other week starting on Monday, Managing Director Brian Abernathy announced Friday. The city has struggled to keep up with trash and recycling collection this week as the coronavirus crisis continues. Officials announced Thursday that they were running one day behind on collections and will continue pickups on Saturday to catch up. Weekly trash pickup will continue, Abernathy said, but residents should hold onto their recycling next week and put it out the following week. Abernathy said the every-other-week pickup for recycling will continue through at least the week of May 15. Trash pick-up will remain as close to its normal schedule as possible, he said, but “residents should expect some delays.” Trash will not be picked up next Friday due to the Good Friday holiday. — Laura McCrystal // Timestamp 04/03 00:53pm As the coronavirus pandemic has coursed through Philadelphia, the drug markets in Kensington haven’t slowed — they’ve simply adapted. And residents, already accustomed to living in the heart of the city’s drug trade and the violence that accompanies it, fear that authorities have virtually halted drug enforcement, leaving corners crowded with dealers who don’t even bother to hide because they don’t think they’ll end up in jail. The surreal scenes have played out in the weeks since Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw announced a new policy in which officers are not to take into custody most people suspected of narcotics crimes. Instead, cops issue warrants for the person to be arrested after the pandemic subsides, a decision supported by advocates, the police union, and District Attorney Larry Krasner. Law enforcement statistics show that scale of the change. — Chris Palmer, Mike Newall // Timestamp 04/03 00:39pm The coronavirus crisis has had a special and profound impact on women who are pregnant or have recently given birth. Anxiety abounds that they’ll contract the virus or that their newborn will. Some are fleeing hotspots like New York to seek care elsewhere. And most women in labor can have just one person with them, if that. Much of the fear comes from the need to be in hospitals or doctors’ offices for prenatal care — checkups, ultrasounds, blood-pressure monitoring — as well as for delivery and those critical first few days after the infant is born, while both baby and mother are typically confined to the hospital. The science isn’t yet certain on whether mothers who contract COVID-19 can pass it to a fetus. And hospitals are taking steps to keep COVID-19 patients isolated, especially from other at-risk patients like pregnant women, and expanding telemedicine and remote care capabilities. But there’s more to be done to help pregnant women maintain social distancing, and physicians at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania are now fast-tracking high-tech solutions that aim to keep them away from the hospital as much as possible before delivery, and to get them out of the hospital sooner after birth. — Anna Orso // Timestamp 04/03 00:24pm While states are struggling to bring in more ventilators to support critically ill COVID-19 patients, a new challenge is already on the horizon: a looming shortage of more than a dozen medications needed to intubate patients and keep them on a ventilator. Demand for many of the sedatives, and pain and muscle relaxant medications necessary for ventilator use shot up by more than 50% in March, while the fill rate dropped at least 25% — meaning some hospitals were unable to get the full amount of medication they ordered, according to findings by Vizient, which provides analysis and advisory services for health systems. A surge in COVID-19 patients that is still expected in many states could further strain supply. “My fear is we’ll look back in a few weeks and have enough ventilators but we won’t have any of the drugs,” said Dan Kistner, a pharmacist and a senior vice president of pharmacy services at Vizient. “It’s like having all these cars and no gas to make them run.” — Sarah Gantz // Timestamp 04/03 11:00am Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration on Friday told nearly 9,000 state employees — more than 10% of its workforce — that it will stop paying them by the end of next week in order to reduce spending as the coronavirus shutdown continues to batter the economy. The affected employees have jobs that cannot be completed through teleworking, according to the administration, which began shuttering state offices in mid-March to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Starting April 11, those workers will have to use vacation, sick, or other personal leave time if they want to continue receiving paychecks. Otherwise, they can file for unemployment. It is unclear how long the state will withhold paychecks, although Wolf has said that state offices will remain closed until at least April 30. The administration said it will continue providing health care benefits for all affected workers. — Angela Couloumbis / Spotlight PA // Timestamp 04/03 10:55am A Rowan University chemistry professor this week made good use of a lot of chemicals sitting idle in largely empty campus labs. Jim Grinias and his wife, Kaitlin, an automation chemist who works in the pharmaceutical industry, made nearly 20 gallons of hand sanitizer for use by Cooper University health care providers. The couple gathered supplies, including ethanol, hydrogen peroxide and glycerol, from science and math labs and mixed the sanitizer in a Rowan lab, the university said. They followed a recipe and guidance issued by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “It seems like a lot, but I think it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed,” Grinias said in a statement. “Everyone needs to chip in and do what they can.” — Susan Snyder // Timestamp 04/03 10:40am Stay-at-home orders in hopes of preventing the spread of the coronavirus have fundamentally altered life in Philadelphia. Inquirer photographers explore iconic areas of the city to illustrate those changes. — Inquirer Staff Photographers // Timestamp 04/03 10:30am Corona beer, which became an online punchline as the coronavirus spread across the planet, will halt production due to restrictions put in place by the Mexican government. Grupo Modello, which also owns Pacifico and Modelo, announced Thursday night it will suspend production until April 30 due to shutdown of all “non-essential activities” in Mexico. The country considers agriculture and food production essential, but not the production of beer. “If the federal government considers it appropriate to issue some clarification confirming beer as an agro-industrial product, at Grupo Modelo we are ready to execute a plan with more than 75% of our staff working from home and at the same time guaranteeing the supply of beer,” the company said in a statement. Heineken, which owns Tecate and Dos Equis, could also be forced to cease production on Friday, according to the Reforma newspaper. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. — Rob Tornoe  // Timestamp 04/03 9:35am Stocks opened flat on Friday as investors continue to weigh massive job losses due to the coronavirus, along with a spike in crude oil prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down about 100 points, just 0.5%, following a small rally on Thursday fueled mostly by hopes of an agreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia that would end a brutal oil price war. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 opened down slightly on Friday. The Dow and S&P 500 remain down more than 25% from their all-time highs set back in February — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 04/03 9:25am Nearly 100,000 surgical masks have been sent to prisons to protect inmates from the coronavirus, courtesy of Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill, Sixers partner Michael Rubin, and their criminal justice reform organization. On Friday, the REFORM Alliance rushed 50,000 masks into New York’s Rikers Island, where hundreds of inmates and staff have been infected with the virus, with the help of author and prison reform advocate Shaka Senghor. They plan to deliver another 2,500 masks to a Rikers’ medical facility; 40,000 to the Tennessee Department of Corrections; and, 5,000 to the Mississippi State Penitentiary, the organization said in a statement. Their deliveries come as prisons across the country start to see cases of the virus and activists call for reductions in the prison population to prevent widespread outbreaks like the one at Rikers Island. In the Philadelphia region, cases have been reported in city jails, as well as in correctional facilities in Montgomery, Delaware, and Chester counties. — Erin McCarthy // Timestamp 04/03 08:40am The U.S. economy lost 701,000 jobs in March, sending the unemployment rate up a tick to 4.4% according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday morning. But it’s only a hint of what’s to come as businesses remained shuttered by state governments as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. The monthly report is based on surveys conducted three weeks ago, while most businesses remained opened and before COVID-19 began to spread rapidly across the country. “You’re just seeing the leading edge of what’s going to happen,” Steven Rattner, a Wall Street financier and the former head of President Obama’s automobile task force, warned on MSNBC Friday morning. Rattner predicts the unemployment rate could reach as high as 15%. The addition of nearly 10 million people to the jobless rolls in the past two weeks would put the nation’s unemployment rate closer to 10%, experts say, a level not seen since the 2008-2009 Great Recession. In Israel, the unemployment rate is 24.9%, up from just 4% in February before the government issued a strict lockdown in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus. Countries throughout Europe, hard hit by COVID-19, are reporting similar numbers. Initial unemployment claims soared to 6.6 million for the week ending March 28, according to data released Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor. In Pennsylvania alone, 783,000 people have filed unemployment claims in just the past two weeks, the second most in the country, behind California. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 04/03 08:25am At least seven people at a Bucks County facility for people with intellectual disabilities have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Four residents and three staff members at Woods Services in Langhorne have tested positive, and additional residents have exhibited symptoms consistent with those of the coronavirus, Woods’ president and CEO said in a letter to the community. The four residents have been moved into an isolation residence, as have others who are sick and awaiting test results, said Tine Hansen-Turton, the president and CEO. For weeks, she said, Woods has been monitoring residents for symptoms, screening staff members with temperature checks, operating on a no-visitor policy, and preparing two isolation residences that have negative pressure rooms, personal personal equipment for staff, and other supplies. But, she said, “we have also operated under the assumption that we would be facing this scenario eventually.” Woods Services, a nonprofit, provides care for more than 4,000 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, brain trauma, and other behavioral conditions, and employs 6,000 people. — Erin McCarthy // Timestamp 04/03 05:00am A slew of new coronavirus tests is coming — and so is confusion. Stephen Hahn, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, didn’t help matters Thursday when he told CBS radio, “We’re going to announce today our first approval of a serology test that will, in laboratories, allow the labs to determine exposure in the antibodies.” A few moments later, he added that those serology tests “aren’t FDA approved. but we’ve given them the flexibility to go forward as long as they’ve done their own quality assurance."" Serology tests — so called because they examine the blood serum — could be transformative in managing the pandemic, if they work. In theory, the tests could help diagnose and even treat infections. The tests might also identify people who could safely go back to work, and answer questions about the transmissibility and lethality of the virus. But just like the laborious, time-consuming molecular tests that have been used worldwide to diagnose the coronavirus over the last three months, the serology versions are fraught with unknowns and pitfalls. — Marie McCullough // Timestamp 04/03 04:45am Due to the spread of the coronavirus, the Boeing Co. on Friday shut down operations at its Ridley Park, Delaware County, plant for two weeks. The decision, announced Thursday night, comes two weeks after the aviation giant said it would keep the military helicopter plant open. “This action is intended to ensure the well-being of employees, their families and local communities, and will include an orderly shutdown consistent with requirements of the U.S. and global defense customers,” the company said. Boeing said it would conduct deep cleaning at the Ridley Park plant and “establish rigorous criteria for return to work."" The plant employs more than 4,600 workers who make H-47 Chinook, V-22 Osprey, and MH-139A Grey Wolf helicopters.

Earlier this week, Lizzo sent meals to hospitals in Detroit, Minneapolis, and Seattle. — Sarah Gantz // Timestamp 04/03 04:30am U.S. officials are moving closer to recommending that people should wear a cloth mask or facial covering in public settings like grocery stores to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The policy would be new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has for weeks said only medical professionals, those who are sick, or those caring for the sick needed to wear masks. But over the last week, as an escalating number of Americans tested positive for the virus, pressure has mounted for the agency to revise its recommendations The recommendation would be an acknowledgement that making a mask out of fabric or a T-shirt could help prevent carriers of the virus from spreading it if they cough or sneeze while in public, particularly before the onset of symptoms. At a briefing Thursday, Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, described the new advisory as “an additive piece,” saying a mask was not a replacement for social distancing and hand washing. “We want to make sure everybody understands it’s not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out,” she said. — Anna Orso // Timestamp 04/02 4:15am Coronavirus cases continue to rise in Pennsylvania, with the state reporting 1,211 new cases Thursday, and at least four New Jersey hospitals reached capacity as Gov. Phil Murphy announced 182 more deaths and a total case count over 25,000. “The increases we’re seeing are not just [because] of more testing,” Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine said at Thursday’s briefing in Harrisburg. “We’re seeing more cases.” Philadelphia hospitals, too, were seeing increases in the number of hospitalized patients, and Montgomery County officials anticipated higher percentages of people testing positive. The number of coronavirus cases worldwide passed one million on Thursday, as the death toll in New York, the epicenter for this country, neared 2,400 and the number of infected people there approached 100,000. The Labor Department said that nearly 10 million jobs have been lost since the pandemic reached the United States. The number of cases in Pennsylvania topped 7,000 as Thursday dawned, the first full day Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order was in place statewide.

250,"Coronavirus math shows the importance of social distancing, and the horrible consequences of not doing it","As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. If you still doubt the crucial importance of avoiding other people, or if you think Philadelphia’s “stay at home” order is excessive, consider this: Without the lockdown in Wuhan, China, where the pandemic started, there would have been 44,214 cases in other Chinese cities through February — instead of the actual number of 27,956, according to a new study led by University of Pennsylvania economist Hanming Fang. “Social distancing and, if an epicenter can be identified, as was the case for the city of Wuhan in China, a lockdown can play crucial roles in ‘flattening’ the daily infection cases curve, giving the stressed medical system a chance to regroup and deal with the onslaught of new infection cases,” wrote Fang and his coauthors. “Flatten the curve” has become a rallying cry, but in New Jersey and New York, it appears to be too late. In both states, the average daily rate of increase is more than 50%, according to an Inquirer analysis of data from Sunday. As a trickle of patients has turned into a deluge, New York City hospitals are scrambling to find more ventilators and protective gear, and New Jersey is moving to reopen the former Inspira Medical Center Woodbury in Gloucester County as an intensive care facility. In Pennsylvania, which so far has 644 reported cases, the tally is increasing at an average daily rate of 34%. Though lower, that’s still a growth trajectory that will lead to an overwhelming surge in patients needing hospitalization. And because testing in Pennsylvania has ramped up only in the past week, the growth rate may actually be higher. An analysis by Politico and the COVID19 Tracking Project found that New York has done about 61,400 tests, more than any other state. Pennsylvania has done about 5,400. New Jersey, meanwhile, has done relatively few tests — 2,300 — but more than half have been positive, suggesting that undiagnosed cases are widespread. No one yet knows how readily the virus can be transmitted before it causes symptoms, and asymptomatic transmission has been well documented. Drawing on emerging worldwide data, University of California, San Diego biologist Robert A.J. Signer and art director Gary Warshaw created a graphic that clearly and simply conveys the effect of reducing exposure to the virus through social distancing. Here’s their math: Symptoms of the respiratory illness develop on an average of five days after infection. During those five days, called the incubation period, the virus can spread. If the rate of spread is the same for those with and without symptoms, then one infected person transmits the virus to 2.5 other people on average, and those 2.5 people each transmit to 2.5 more people, and so on. Within 30 days, 406 people would be infected. Social distancing that reduces interaction by 50% would halve the chances of spreading the virus, so one person would only infect 1.25 other people on average, and there would only be 15 infected people in 30 days, Signer calculated. But if people stay home and transmission is cut by 75% — so that an infected person spreads the disease to less than one other person on average — new infections will eventually subside and stop. That’s what has happened in Wuhan, where the 50-day lockdown is now being eased. “The major purpose of our graphic was to educate people about the importance of social distancing to safeguard our communities,"" Signer said on Monday. Can Philadelphia and the rest of Pennsylvania avoid a surge of patients at this point? Probably not entirely, given the current uptick in admissions of patients with COVID-19, according to Meghan Lane-Fall, an intensive care doctor, anesthesiologist, and researcher at Penn Medicine. But in a piece she wrote for The Inquirer, she said social distancing is the biggest step we can take “to give everyone who falls to this virus the best chance.” “Every person who does not truly need to be out, interacting with other people, needs to stay home, even if you feel well, even if you are at low risk,” she wrote. “This is not a drill. This is not an overreaction.” Disruptive, depressing, and difficult as staying home is, the alternative is worse. “I have never told someone that they would die because I didn’t have enough equipment,” she wrote. “But that is what we are facing.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:46 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:46 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,OOQIN2U3XBBYFOJWQVYUXRJWSA

163,"Bryce Harper, wife Kayla donate $500,000 to coronavirus relief","Bryce Harper donated $500,000 on Thursday toward coronavirus relief in Las Vegas and Philadelphia, the two cities the Phillies star considers to be home. Harper and his wife, Kayla, donated to Direct Relief and Three Square in Las Vegas and Philabundance in Philadelphia. Direct Relief is a nonprofit humanitarian aid organization with a mission to improve the health and lives of people affected by poverty or emergencies. Three Square is a food bank that provides more than 41 million meals per year throughout Southern Nevada. Philabundance is the largest food bank in the Philadelphia region and serves more than 24 million pounds of food a year to those in need. “Las Vegas will always be my family’s first home,” Harper said. “Philadelphia, our home away from home, welcomed us with open arms from day one. These communities mean so much to us, and Kayla and I want to do our part to help battle the effects of the virus in Vegas and Philly.” Harper returned last month to Las Vegas after spring training was canceled and the start of the regular season was suspended. It is unclear when (or if) baseball will be played in 2020. In the meantime, Harper is working out at home — including pushing a weighted sled in the street — and spending time with his 7-month-old son, Krew. “We are blessed to be together as a family during this pandemic but realize many do not have the same luxury,” Harper said. “As the world battles COVID-19 and its effects, we are keeping the faith and praying for a swift return to normalcy.” Harper joined the Phillies last year by signing a $330 million contract, the largest free-agent deal in baseball history. He’s now one of baseball’s highest-paid players and most popular figures. But Harper grew up in a working-class section of Vegas. His father was a union ironworker. His mother was a paralegal. As Harper climbed baseball’s ladder, he reminded himself to remember where he came from. And on Thursday, he made sure to remember the two places he calls home. “Through the power of prayer and helping each other with pure intent and love, we will get through this together,” Harper said. “Faith in our Lord and savior will help heal the world. ... Now is the time to come together and adhere to the guidelines of medical professionals. We are wishing the best to all with our prayers during this time.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:44 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:44 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,KN55M3HFD5HW5D5RKQXGC2NLRM

Track the spread here. Pennsylvania’s unemployment claims over the last two weeks climbed to 783,331, behind only California. The state’s claims during this time are higher than all of last year’s claims, my colleague Andrew Maykuth reports. Experts say Pennsylvania’s numbers are so high because of Gov. Tom Wolf’s early and aggressive shut down orders. For example, while most major construction sites in Pennsylvania have been idled, construction has largely continued in other states. “Pennsylvania arguably has the most restrictive provisions as it relates to businesses continuing to operate,” said Gene Barr, president of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. Nationally, more than 6.6 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week. That is double the amount of people who who sought this aid two weeks ago. In Philly, there is a high concentration of low-wage service workers in the retail and hospitality industries — industries that have been hit hard by the shutdowns — leaving these employees without health-care benefits when they lose their jobs, my colleague Juliana Feliciano Reyes reports. Many hourly workers don’t get health benefits through their jobs because it’s too expensive or not offered, so it’s hard to know exactly how many people are losing coverage. ""They just threw us to the curb,” said Phyllis Davis, 52, a concierge supervisor at the Hampton Inn near the Convention Center, who lost her job. Some people have suggested young people should have a coronavirus party to intentionally get sick. Well, experts say that is a terrible idea. The thinking of these pro-party people is that if young people get the virus, they will likely have mild symptoms, recover, and become immune. That would create “herd immunity,” they argue, meaning they would not be able to transmit the virus to more-vulnerable people. A few people asked The Inquirer if this is a good idea, and my colleague Jonathan Lai set out to answer. Here’s what the experts say: “This is a dangerous idea,” said Megan Culler Freeman, a pediatric infectious disease fellow at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. “This suggestion is a reckless approach to this disease.” “Absolutely not,” said Jen Caudle, a family physician and professor at Rowan University’s School of Osteopathic Medicine. “It’s not that simple.” “Young people can develop serious symptoms as badly as older people in terms of requiring hospitalization,"" said Jayatri Das, chief bioscientist at the Franklin Institute who received her Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton University. ""Not as many of them die, but in terms of hospital admissions and ICU care, we cannot assume that young people will be fine.” So please everyone, do not get sick on purpose. And here is a gentle reminder that all of Pennsylvania has been ordered by the governor to stay at home. 🐶 Honey the dog brings joy and comfort to residents of this senior living center. 🏈 Two Philly sports talkers are launching a new show on SiriusXM’s Dan Patrick Radio channel. 📺 Here’s what’s on this weekend: Meghan Markle narrates a Disney show, LeVar Burton reads for grownups, and Kim Kardashian calls for justice.

165,"Coronavirus cases still rising as officials prepare hospital space and hand out food; more than 25,000 infected in New Jersey","Coronavirus cases continue to rise in Pennsylvania, with the state reporting 1,211 new cases Thursday, and at least four New Jersey hospitals reached capacity as Gov. Phil Murphy announced 182 more deaths and a total case count over 25,000. “The increases we’re seeing are not just [because] of more testing,” Pennsylvania Secretary of Health  Rachel Levine said at Thursday’s briefing in Harrisburg. “We’re seeing more cases.” Philadelphia hospitals, too, were seeing increases in the number of hospitalized patients, and Montgomery County officials anticipated higher percentages of people testing positive.

The state has lost 90 people to the virus, and the death toll in New Jersey hit 537. Statewide, 69 Pennsylvania nursing homes have reported at least one positive case, Levine said, and at least 345 health-care workers have been sickened. And in New Jersey, at least 110 of the state’s 375 long-term care facilities have one or more cases, Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said. Many of New Jersey’s infected long-term care residents have been infected by workers who aren’t showing symptoms, a trend that mirrors what happened in Washington. In contrast, Bucks County health officials reported an overall decrease in the spread of the coronavirus, although most such cases are doctors, nurses, first responders, store workers, and other essential workers serving the community. “We are definitely seeing a decrease in the number of cases who don’t know where the heck they got it,” county Health Director David Damsker said. And between 50 and 60 people of the 407 who have tested positive for the coronavirus have recovered and come out of quarantine, he said. » HELP US REPORT: Are you a health care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker or other expert? We want to hear from you. Philadelphia had a total of 2,100 confirmed cases and two people had died in the last day, Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said Thursday, bringing the city’s death count to 17. Philadelphia hospitals have checked in 315 infected patients, some who are not local residents, Farley said, suggesting that more patients from out of state may end up in the city’s hospitals as New York City and New Jersey have severe outbreaks. The  city’s jails have 20 inmates with the coronavirus, and Farley said clusters of infections continue to be found in group settings like nursing homes. Three staff members and one inmate at the Chester County jail have tested positive for COVID-19, county officials said Thursday. “Right now, social distancing is the most practical ‘cure’ we have to beat” the virus, said the Chester County commissioners, announcing the county’s second and third deaths, of men ages 79 and 87. As people continue to isolate from others, calls to state mental health resources have increased, Levine said. More than six million people filed for unemployment benefits last week as virus-related shutdowns ravage the economy — and Pennsylvanians filed the highest number of claims after California, whose population is about three times that of the commonwealth. In the last two weeks, Pennsylvania had 783,000 new claims. New Jersey reported 205,515 new claims last week, nearly twice as many as the previous week. Murphy said 500 Garden State employers have posted more than 44,000 job openings on the state’s coronavirus website. Murphy said relief is on the way for hospitals in New Jersey — where seven were at capacity Wednesday and have since moved patients to other facilities — as the state’s first Army Corps of Engineers temporary field hospital is slated to open early next week. At its peak, the Secaucus site will accommodate 250 beds and will be staffed primarily by a volunteer force of doctors, nurses, social workers, and behavioral health workers. A 500-bed unit in Edison will open Wednesday, and a site in Atlantic City is slated to open April 14. Once those are open, three major hospitals will coordinate the transfer of patients beginning recovery to the temporary sites.  While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prepared to urge all Americans to wear cloth masks in public, Murphy said he would not order healthy New Jerseyans to wear masks because the state must preserve its limited supply of protective equipment for infected people and front-line health-care workers. Philadelphia’s Farley also said he was not recommending the practice for city residents. In Philadelphia, the city continued to work to expand hospital capacity and was still “fighting for supplies,” Managing Director Brian Abernathy said. City officials received a shipment Wednesday from the National Strategic Stockpile, he said, and were still working Thursday to unpack it. The food distribution program that began in Philadelphia this week — offering one box of food per household to all residents as a supplement to the city’s food pantry system — had such high demand that the city quadrupled the number of meals it handed out Thursday, offering 16,000 at 40 locations. Even so, some sites ran out of meal boxes. “It shows how great the need is,” Abernathy said. “We’re going to do everything we can to continue to provide some sustenance and meals to our city.” Abernathy asked able residents to donate to or volunteer with Philabundance or the Share Food program, the city’s partners. It will be a challenge for the city to provide the food long-term, he said. Philadelphia City Council passed an emergency $85 million budget transfer for the city’s response to the crisis Thursday morning, which Mayor Jim Kenney signed into law.  Trash pickup in Philadelphia also began running about a day behind because sanitation workers were calling out from work, but Kenney asked residents to keep putting their trash out normally and to be patient. The Archdiocese of Philadelphia announced Thursday that it will close the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul to the public during livestreamed Easter and Holy Week services — a day after The Inquirer reported that at least two dozen people were served Holy Communion in person last Sunday. Although the cathedral will be closed during the Easter and Holy Week celebrations, it — like many of the archdiocese’s more than 250 churches across the region — will remain open outside of that time for private prayer.   As officials this week have urged residents to continue staying home, to give the state a chance to avoid the type of disaster unfolding in New York and New Jersey, Farley said it was “too early to say” whether social distancing was working. He said it would take time to determine the impact of the prevention measures because several days can pass between a person’s exposure to the virus and a positive test result. So, officials said: Keep staying home. “We have plenty of availability in the health-care system right now, should people need it,” Farley said. “But I want to emphasize we want to keep it that way.” Staff writers Erin McCarthy, Jeremy Roebuck, Kristen A. Graham, Vinny Vella, Ellie Rushing, and staff photographer Michael Bryant, contributed to this article.

166,"This coronavirus pandemic can be lethal to the environment, too | Editorial ","With the attention of most Americans focused on the coronavirus pandemic, industry and retail lobbyists in New Jersey and other states are trying to make the scientifically unconvincing case that reusable bags endanger, and single-use plastic bags benefit, public health. They’re urging the mayors of dozens of Garden State communities to lift their bans on single-use plastic bags; Philadelphia is set to implement a similar ban starting July 2. The cynical campaign by “Big Plastic” is of a piece with efforts at the state and federal level to roll back environmental protections, reduce oversight, subsidize the fossil fuel industry, and undermine what little progress is being made against climate change. Some cite the pandemic as a rationale. In Harrisburg, legislators seized upon public worries about the coronavirus as they organized an effort to override Gov. Tom Wolf’s veto last week of a tax break for manufacturers of fertilizers and petrochemicals who use Pennsylvania-produced methane — a bonanza for fracking and natural gas interests. Estimates of the annual cost to Pennsylvania taxpayers range from $6.6 million to $22 million. Wolf, a Democrat, also cited the epidemic as a rationale for his veto, demonstrating the wide-ranging political utility of the virus. The epidemic also has delayed a New Jersey public hearing on a controversial proposal to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping on the site of a former dynamite factory in Greenwich Township, N.J.: gas fracked in Pennsylvania would be transported across the commonwealth and south through New Jersey by rail. Earlier this week, the Trump administration executed a plan it announced in 2018 that will eviscerate Obama-era fuel economy and emissions standards for new vehicles. Critics said the move means that an additional 1.5 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas will be expelled into the Earth’s atmosphere by 2040. For three years, the White House has systematically targeted environmental regulations and reporting requirements it deems too onerous for big corporations. The president also has cast doubts on climate science, and was similarly skeptical at first about the coronavirus until evidence of its lethal nature became too overwhelming to ignore. Meanwhile, data indicate residents of environmentally challenged neighborhoods near industrial sites may be more vulnerable to respiratory diseases like COVID-19. The digital news site Grist reported Thursday that a “community vulnerability map” developed by a health data firm suggests that living among environmental hazards could make some people prone to health conditions that complicate coronavirus infection. A pandemic may not seem like the right time to tackle environmental issues. But with official meetings and hearings postponed and gatherings suspended, people can and should make their voices heard. Public comments about the proposed LNG terminal in New Jersey may be submitted by email through April 24. Pennsylvanians can contact their representatives in the General Assembly and the Senate about the governor’s veto of the fracking bailout. The bluer skies and clearer air resulting from a world temporarily retreating from its climate-damaging ways should not lull us into complacency. After we defeat the virus, the fight to save the planet must be won as well. Retreating in our efforts now is not a path to victory.

167,How not to destroy your relationship while spending 24/7 together during coronavirus quarantine,"They’re leaving laundry on the floor. Eating all of the quarantine snacks — and not the perishable ones first. And chewing so obnoxiously loud, who can pay attention to this morning Zoom meeting? (Did they always chew like that?) And the constant trail of crumbs left on the kitchen counter…Who is this person I’m living with? Coronavirus quarantining has pushed many of us to spend more time with our partners than ever before. Now we have to figure out how to work, parent, and simply get along as we move through the same rooms all day long. This can quickly deteriorate even the most stable relationships. “This isn’t a vacation in the Bahamas,” says relationship therapist Carole Landis. “For a lot of couples, they’re going from a situation where they’re used to passing like ships in the morning and night to now really being with each other, and under a real amount of stress.” You can’t spell “divorce” without “Covid,"" Twitter users remind us. And in China, where people have been in lockdown for much longer, that concept is feeling a bit like reality. Both cities of Xian and Dazhou reported record numbers of divorce filings in March. So how can you save your relationship during quarantining? We asked local experts for advice. On the bright side, those home-isolating should have plenty of side-by-side time to put it into practice — and, perhaps, come out stronger. Sure, you love your partner’s quirks. But with tensions high and quarters close, that morning humming may suddenly make you want to scream. It could be your partner who’s annoying. Or, pro-tip from editor @mollytolsky for couples suddenly working from home together, it could be an invisible person who’s to blame: “Get yourselves an imaginary coworker to blame things on. In our apartment, Cheryl keeps leaving her dirty water cups all over the place and we really don’t know what to do about her.” But really, communication is best. “What you were able to tolerate before, you now might need to talk about,” says clinical psychologist Deb Derrickson Kossmann. “Communication is essential for preventing your annoyance from turning into anger.” Stress, Kossmann explains, can heighten people’s idiosyncrasies — anxious habits are often coping mechanisms. In other words, don’t be surprised if your partner’s foot tapping or nail biting amps up, which, in turn, could create an irk never felt before. Address it in a way that’s inviting and shows that you notice your partner. Instead of “stop biting your nails,” try “I see you’re biting your nails more than usual, how are you feeling?” “To a point, whoever is more anxious about the virus should win out,” says Nicholaides. “We should try as best as we can to help our partners feel comfortable in this time.” Find a compromise, and do your best to have empathy. If one partner feels better about grocery delivery than grocery shopping, and you can afford it, don’t put up a fight — even if you feel it’s unnecessary. And if they want to wipe down every single grocery, that’s not for you to judge. While it’s your civic duty to stay inside, there’s no need to watch every Netflix show together. “There needs to be a space for you to feel like you — to listen to the music you like, to do your own hobbies,” says Brian Swope, licensed marriage and family therapist of PHL Therapy Collective. “Once you start to feel like you’re losing who you are in a relationship, that brings on a whole new type of anxiety.” Don’t feel selfish if you want to take walks by yourself. Personal space can be refreshing, and make you a better partner. It’s still important to schedule date nights. “Just because you’re spending 24/7 together doesn’t mean you’re spending quality time together,” says clinical psychologist and couples therapy specialist Anna Nicholaides. Order delivery from your favorite restaurant, or, as Nicholaides suggests, try a new experience. And keep it playful. “Although we can’t go very far while sheltering in place, our minds have an unlimited capacity to journey to new spaces, while being silly encourages flirting,” says Nicholaides. Throw on some music, and make a pillow fort. Or have a pillow fight. You could also cover your table with paper, and draw a cityscape together. Or finger paint. Puzzles are trending right now. Don’t own one? Take a cue from this guy who built his own: Being in a relationship lets you navigate life’s ups and downs with a co-pilot by your side. Show extra kindness to remind each other you’re in this together. “If your partner’s in a work meeting, bring them a cup of coffee,” suggests Nicholaides. “Small acts of kindness can make them feel less alone in the world.” Other ideas: notes on the bathroom mirror, affectionate afternoon texts even when in the same room, slipping in a treat on your next grocery run. Stress can lower your libido, but if you’re in a good place with your partner, Nicholaides encourages you not to let stress stop sex. “It might be harder to get into that headspace right now, but try to keep in mind its benefits,” says Nicholaides. “Sex releases oxytocin, the ‘love hormone,' that can make you feel closer and bonded together.” Trapped in close quarters, tense moments are inevitable. Landis shares a pro-arguing tip: Write your frustrations in a notebook. “Twice a week, sit down and share one, and only one, criticism with each other,” says Landis. For those with kids, block out time to do this far away from their ears. “Kids need stability right now,” says Landis. “Every year, you should re-establish your needs. Now that you’re spending more time at home, those needs are likely to change, so you need to reopen that conversation,” says Landis. “If suddenly you need alone time in the shower, but your partner’s used to barging in, they’re not going to know unless you tell them.” Be specific and direct. Skip statements that begin with “you never” (...help with the chores) and “you always” (...forget to take out the trash), says Landis. “These absolute statements give the other person nowhere to go — they’re cornered,” says Landis. “Reminding someone of their shortcomings isn’t motivating.” Write down what soothes you (music, meditation, running, etc.). Then, make a second list of things your partner does that help you relax, whether it’s back scratches or making the morning coffee. “It’s a small toolkit of ways you can care for one another and a cushion for when there are the inevitable arguments,” says Nicholaides. To keep your spirits lifted, schedule a daily laugh session, and use it as a bonding moment. “It could be as simple as routinely sending a funny meme to each other every afternoon,” says Kossman. “A sense of humor through all this can help relieve built up stress.” Unfortunately we can’t go around hugging family and friends right now. But you can embrace your partner. End the day on a positive note, says Landis, by remembering to say goodnight. “No matter how exhausted you are, a kiss or hug each night can go a long way,” says Landis.

168,"Coronavirus will accelerate EMS crisis in Pa.’s small towns and rural areas, experts say","This story was produced as part of a joint effort among Spotlight PA, LNP Media Group, PennLive, PA Post, and WITF to cover how Pennsylvania state government is responding to the coronavirus. Sign up for Spotlight PA’s newsletter. HARRISBURG — When an EMT fell ill with the coronavirus in Upper Merion Township, the department saw its ranks suddenly dwindle. In all, 22 emergency personnel, including the fire chief, were quarantined for two weeks. “It weighs on your mind at night,” said Public Safety Director Thomas Nolan, who doubles as the suburban Philadelphia community’s police chief. “I can’t even see the enemy on this one to worry about my people. I worry about it constantly.” Health officials in Montgomery County have since eased the rules concerning who must quarantine after interacting with someone who tests positive for the coronavirus — there were simply too many cases for it to be effective — but the experience gave Nolan a troubling glimpse into what the near future may hold for the roughly 1,300 emergency medical service agencies across the state. Nearly a quarter of Pennsylvania’s EMS agencies shut down between 2012 and 2018 due to budget and staffing shortfalls. Now, the coronavirus represents the ultimate test of a fragile system. “We are going to see more ambulance companies go out of business,” said Jerry Ozog, a longtime paramedic and executive director of the Pennsylvania Fire and Emergency Services Institute. “[The coronavirus] is going to cause them to go into the red. They’re not going to be able to pay their people or to survive.” In Pennsylvania, most EMS agencies outside big cities are supported almost entirely via reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurers. The problem, according to EMS officials, is that reimbursements represent a fraction of the actual costs. Insurers, meanwhile, send the checks directly to patients who often fail to pass them along. “People want a Cadillac ambulance service,” Ozog said, “but they’re not willing to pay for it.” Compounding the financial strain are long-standing recruitment and retention issues. According to a 2018 legislative study of the issue, the number of emergency medical technicians in Pennsylvania fell by more than 6,000 since 2012 and the number of paramedics decreased by 4,000 over the same period. That’s due in part to the pay. In Pennsylvania, the average salary for the two professions is $34,310, though federal data lump them into the same category. EMTs generally make closer to $20,000 per year while paramedics make closer to $40,000. Paramedics are trained in more specialized care than EMTs, allowing them to give drugs and set up IV lines. “To make a life-sustaining wage in this business, paramedics may work for three different ambulance services,” said Ozog, who also serves as a volunteer firefighter in Hampden Township, Cumberland County. “If somebody gets sick due to the virus, it may put them out of service for a month. And it may put three ambulance services out of commission.” Heather Sharar, executive director of the Ambulance Association of Pennsylvania, said she expects all of these problems to worsen as the pandemic reaches more vulnerable rural EMS agencies. In March, the trade organization began collecting financial data from its members in an effort to keep track of COVID-19’s economic impact. For one, she said, a surge in demand for service could upset the delicate balance these companies maintain to stay in the black. On the other side, sick patients who lose their jobs in the ensuing recession may be even less likely to turn over their reimbursement checks. “If you can’t afford to pay staff and they don’t have anyone to man the ambulance, what are you going to do?” Sharar said. Rural EMS agencies are already starting to feel the crunch because, in the absence of municipal funding or insurance reimbursements, they rely heavily on fund-raisers. Scott Dolan, chief of the Hiller Volunteer Fire Company in Fayette County, said his organization’s weekly fund-raisers have been canceled for the last month. Now, he’s got a freezer full of fish for a fry that won’t happen anytime soon and a reserve fund that could be drained in a matter of months. “If we don’t have a fund-raiser for three months, bills are not going to be paid and we’ll be in a serious financial crisis,” said Dolan, who also serves as a paramedic. Of his company’s 40 volunteer firefighters, half of them are also trained to respond to ambulance calls. Dolan said his volunteer company has enough personal protective equipment for just 50 patients. He’s working with the county’s emergency management agency to ensure a steady supply of gowns, masks, and other equipment. Like many EMS leaders, Dolan relies on local dispatchers to screen calls in advance so he can use the equipment he has strategically. If the caller or the patient can’t answer certain questions, they assume it’s a positive case. His medics already reuse their N95 respirators, assuming they haven’t been contaminated, and he’s trying to obtain plastic-coated gowns that could be disinfected and hung out to dry between calls. The state started with a stockpile of one million N95 respirators before the COVID-19 outbreak, Department of Health spokesperson Nate Wardle said. So far, it has been able to distribute 1.3 million with 112,000 coming from the federal stockpile and the rest donated or obtained via state procurement. Wardle said the state is “anticipating another 121,000” respirators from the federal stockpile “but do not know when or if they may come.” There are several measures being contemplated to help EMS agencies survive the onslaught of COVID-19. For one, they can apply for Small Business Administration loans under the recent federal stimulus. And at least two state House proposals — from Cris Dush (R., Jefferson) and Pam Snyder (D., Greene) — would set aside emergency funding for firefighting and EMS agencies. But Ozog said there needs to be a long-term solution. That could include requiring insurers to send reimbursements directly to ambulance companies or creating countywide authorities that would use taxpayer money to oversee ambulance services. Both would require legislative action. “The system will not look the same after this,” Ozog said, “because of the financial fragility of the system we have now.” Upper Merion Township is in a better position than many other small EMS agencies — it gets support from local taxpayers. That’s a fairly recent development, however. The township’s original community-based ambulance service, similar to Hiller’s in Western Pennsylvania, disbanded two years ago, prompting the municipality to take over. Nolan said his agency has taken steps to better protect frontline workers, including designating two ambulances exclusively for suspected COVID-19 cases, with plastic sheeting and other decontamination equipment. They’ve also eliminated most in-person meetings, reduced the number of personnel responding to any one call, and separated EMT staff between two locations to avoid a similar situation in which a large number of first responders need to be quarantined at the same time. But Nolan’s biggest adjustment has been mental. “After 35 years in law enforcement, it’s one of the hardest things to deal with,” he said. “I’m used to throwing resources, personnel at a problem and fixing it. I’ve had to adjust to the mind-set of: You need to keep people away from this.” 100% ESSENTIAL: Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

169,Coronavirus ventilator treatment could be hindered by drug shortage at hospitals,"As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. While states are struggling to bring in more ventilators to support critically ill COVID-19 patients, a new challenge is already on the horizon: a looming shortage of more than a dozen medications needed to intubate patients and keep them on a ventilator. Demand for many of the sedatives and pain and muscle relaxant medications necessary for ventilator use shot up by more than 50% in March, while the fill rate dropped at least 25% — meaning some hospitals were unable to get the full amount of medication they ordered, according to findings by Vizient, which provides analysis and advisory services for health systems. A surge in COVID-19 patients that is still expected in many states could further strain supply. “My fear is we’ll look back in a few weeks and have enough ventilators but we won’t have any of the drugs,” said Dan Kistner, a pharmacist and a senior vice president of pharmacy services at Vizient. “It’s like having all these cars and no gas to make them run.” Ventilating a patient is an invasive and painful procedure that requires inserting a tube down the patient’s airway to his lungs, to allow the machine to take over breathing. Our gag reflexes are so strong that it is impossible to properly place the tube without sedating the patient, and muscle relaxers are often necessary to relax the windpipe, said Marcus Schabacker, CEO of ECRI Institute, a nonprofit in Montgomery County that studies health-care quality, safety, and efficiency. Once connected to the ventilator, patients must remain in a medical coma, with sedation and pain medications, he said. “The ventilation process itself is so intolerable that an awake patient would not tolerate it,” said Schabacker, an anesthesiologist and intensive care specialist. “The reversal of lung function is so counter to anything your physiology would allow, we need to put the patient in an artificial coma.” » ASK US: Do you have a question about the coronavirus and how it affects your health, work and life? Ask our reporters. The amount of medication needed depends how long the patient will need the ventilator and the severity of the lung illness. The coronavirus outbreak has especially strained supply of these medications because COVID-19 patients needing a ventilator are experiencing extreme respiratory difficulty and may need to remain on a ventilator for days or weeks, all the while needing constant high doses of sedatives and pain medications. “If we continue to see a surge of patients, if we are not able to flatten the curve more substantially, medical supplies, drug supplies, will become the next big issue,” along with a shortage of skilled medical workers, Schabacker said. Vizient’s analysis of 13 commonly used medications suggests that hospitals are still getting the medications they need, but that supply is beginning to dwindle and shortages may not be far off if manufacturers don’t accelerate production, Kistner said. Vizient found that at the beginning of March, demand and supply were both low for these drugs — and hospitals were able to obtain nearly all the doses they requested. But as ventilator use picked up, demand for these medications increased, and hospitals were less able to get everything they needed: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates prescription medications, “has been closely monitoring the supply chain with the expectation that the COVID-19 outbreak would likely impact the medical product supply chain, including potential disruptions to supply or shortages of critical medical products in the U.S.,” said Jeremy Kahn, a spokesperson for the agency. Andrew Powaleny, a spokesperson for the pharmaceutical industry association PhRMA, said drug companies are working closely with the FDA and global stakeholders “to prevent and mitigate potential shortages.” In the meantime, hospitals are preparing for how a surge in patients could affect supplies. Main Line Health has enough of the medications for current patients, but is trying to conserve its supply by getting patients off ventilators as soon as it is safe and making sure no partial vials of medication are wasted, said Clarke U. Piatt, a pulmonologist and medical director of the ICU at Bryn Mawr Hospital. “We use every drop,” he said. Among COVID-19 patients who will need to be on a ventilator for an extended period, the health system has been using alternative sedatives that are less common because they keep patients sedated longer than is necessary for most medical procedures, Piatt said. “The hardest thing from the health-care-provider standpoint is the unknown — we just don’t know what next week is going to be like,” he said. “We’re trying to prepare for the worst but remain positive.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,BARDO6IQJVFAXP7Q5RRRF3LYHI
170,New coronavirus tests could be powerful tools to manage the pandemic — if they work,"As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. A slew of new coronavirus tests is coming — and so is confusion about them. Stephen Hahn, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, didn’t help matters Thursday when he told CBS radio, “We’re going to announce today our first approval of a serology test that will, in laboratories, allow the labs to determine exposure in the antibodies.” A few moments later, he added that those serology tests “aren’t FDA approved. but we’ve given them the flexibility to go forward as long as they’ve done their own quality assurance."" Serology tests — so called because they examine the blood serum — could be transformative in managing the pandemic, if they work. In theory, the tests could help diagnose and even treat infections. The tests might also identify people who could safely go back to work, and answer questions about the transmissibility and lethality of the virus. But just like the laborious, time-consuming molecular tests that have been used worldwide to diagnose the coronavirus over the last three months, the serology versions are fraught with unknowns and pitfalls. Here is an overview: When a virus invades the body, it starts producing telltale proteins, called antigens. The body’s disease-fighting immune system then produces antibodies that zero in on the antigens and neutralize the virus. That’s a bit of an oversimplification, but it’s what Hahn was referring to. Serology tests detect immune activation. Rapid diagnostic tests, which use a sample of blood or another body fluid, look for antigens (think of the influenza and strep tests) or antibodies, (the HIV test), or both. Numerous academic and commercial labs around the world have developed and validated serological antibody tests because of their potential to fill critical needs. Last week, for example, researchers led by Florian Krammer at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, published instructions for making their antibody test to encourage its wide use. » HELP US REPORT: Are you a health care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker or other expert? We want to hear from you. Daniel Stadmauer, a virologist in Krammer’s lab, said the first goal of testing is to recruit recovered COVID-19 patients to donate their blood so the antibody-laden plasma can be extracted and given to critically ill patients. Mount Sinai has so far given “convalescent plasma” to four patients. Another goal is to screen workers, starting with health-care providers, to find those with enough antibodies to safely return to work. “That could restart the economy,” he said. “There is already talk of ‘immunity passports’ in European countries."" Experts agree that serology tests could also identify people who lack immunity so they can be first in line for a vaccine, which could be available within 18 months. Ultimately, with population testing, called serosurveys, public health authorities could map the full scope of the pandemic and be on guard for resurgences. China has begun doing such serosurveys. In the United States, United Biomedical is offering its antibody test, free, to all 8,000 resident of Telluride, the wealthy Colorado ski town where the company’s cofounders have a residence. If serology tests are so quick and easy, why haven’t we been using them since the beginning of the pandemic? One reason is that looking for secondary evidence of a disease-causing germ is tricky. Timing matters; if there aren’t enough antigens or antibodies to be detected, that can undermine the accuracy. Or, if the test isn’t precise enough in probing for a protein, it may detect antibodies to the wrong virus, a problem called cross-reaction. Coronaviruses that cause common colds can cross-react with tests for the new virus. “There is a lot we don’t know about the immune response to the virus,” said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious-disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “What antibody [level] is enough for immunity? We have to make some assumptions.” “The clinical value of these tests is not known yet,” researchers wrote in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. There are “challenges such as cross-reactivity, and ... sometimes the test does not detect the virus when it is there.” The Spanish government can attest. It bought and then withdrew 340,000 Chinese-made coronavirus antibody testing kits, deeming the test too inaccurate to use to diagnose patients. The maker, Bioeasy Technology, said it would replace some of the tests. Until now, worldwide diagnosis of coronavirus has relied on time-consuming molecular tests that use PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to look for viral RNA in nasal swab samples. But even this highly sensitive technology isn’t perfect; in one Chinese study, 30% of infected patients got negative results. Over the last month, the FDA’s regulation of coronavirus testing has gone from restrictive (only the government’s test was initially authorized for emergency use) to liberal. Now, any lab or company that wants to roll out a molecular PCR test for coronavirus can do so as long as the maker submits data to the FDA for review within 15 days. As for serology tests, the makers don’t even have to go through FDA review because the tests “are less complex than molecular tests and are solely used to identify antibodies to the virus.” Makers still have to validate their serology tests, notify the FDA, and include warnings that the results “should not be used as the sole basis” for a diagnosis. Nonetheless, Cellex, a North Carolina company, went through FDA review and got an emergency authorization, issued Wednesday, for its serology test. Cellex is the “first approval of a serology test” that Hahn referred to.

172,Coronavirus kept us from Italy. It remains in our hearts – and kitchen | Craig LaBan,"American Airlines Flight 198 should be landing at Milan Malpensa Airport early this Sunday morning, April 5, and my family was scheduled to be on it. My daughter, Alice, had achieved a lifelong goal of studying in Italy and was enrolled at Bocconi University. We were going to pick her up and whisk her off to eat casoncelli in Bergamo, visit a rice farm in Piedmont and a famous Parmigiano-Reggiano producer in Emilia-Romagna, gorge on prosciutto in Parma, and then celebrate her 21st birthday by waking up in the farmhouse of a Tuscan vineyard, cheesemaker and olive grove called Corzano e Paterno. We’d been saving for months. But you know what happened next as the coronavirus catastrophe began to take shape. The trip was cancelled. Alice’s semester abroad — an experience like the one that changed my life — was cut short. She thankfully made it home, though, healthy and safe. In early March, I took my time to mope about what seemed important back then, the mere unraveling of a dream family vacation as a distant virus raged across the ocean. But that quickly turned to heartache and concern for my Italian friends as the crisis worsened. We began scrambling to get Alice home even sooner than expected. And then, by the time I sat at the counter of Marc Vetri’s new Fiorella on March 12, eating some extraordinary pastas for consolation just inches away from some stranger a few days before Philadelphia’s own shutdown and social distancing edict were to be enacted, it was clear the global nightmare was fast becoming ours, too. Coronavirus cases had just begun to be reported locally. Even so, as I dove into plate after plate of perfect pasta (oh, that creamy, peppery tonnarelli cacio e pepe!), toasting Negronis with my neighbors at the counter and joking with the chefs, I had no real notion this would be my final meal inside an actual restaurant dining room for the foreseeable future. It seemed inconceivable, even as the idea was discussed. And yet, four days later, Vetri would close his restaurants to the public, joining the statewide shutdown of dining rooms and other non-essential businesses on March 16. There are far more pressing issues now than lamenting the inability to dine in a restaurant — existential ones — such as whether many Philly restaurants will survive this crisis at all, and the horrific number of restaurant people suddenly out of work. COVID-19′s local toll on lives and the food industry keeps rising. But the confluence of factors that final night at Fiorella — the cancelled trip, the persistent fears of all the unknowns to come and, especially, the anxiety of trying to get my daughter back safe from Europe— felt like a moment when all those personal concerns became part of something larger. Good food on its own cannot solve the biggest problems. But it can help us to cope. And so I have been devouring — and making — so much pasta since. Call it comfort cooking, for sure. In my mind, every strand of toothy noodle is a small act of hopeful defiance, willing that somehow, some day, eating a plate of beautiful noodles will once again be a simple daily pleasure, one we can once more take for granted. I certainly don’t take Philly’s pasta pros for granted, and I’ve been supporting as many of the restaurants that are trying to keep the lights on through take-out and delivery as possible. I’ve ordered the fantastic new take-out kits of fresh-extruded pasta with vacuum-sealed bags of mix-and-match sauces and meats from Little Noodle Co. through the Messina Social Club. I’m looking forward to also ordering soon from Cry Baby Pasta (chicken riggies!), DaMò Pasta Lab (tagliatelle Bolognese), Villa di Roma (spaghetti and meatballs plus an order of veal and eggplant Parm); L’Anima and Melograno (all’Amatriciana), Trattoria Carina (gemelli with pistachio pesto), and Fiorella’s, too, which has been selling-out online orders of carry-out sausage ragù, cacio e pepe, and polenta-Taleggio ravioli. Still, I’ve missed the shared communal energy of being in restaurants. And in a small way, being able to reach out to local chefs and having them talk me through some of their specialties so I can attempt to make their food has helped bring a glimmer of their magic home. I set a sauté pan with wine, garlic, chile flakes and lemon to steam open dozens of littlenecks to try to recreate Michael Vincent Ferrari’s spaghetti alle vongole from Res Ipsa — then marveled as the al dente noodles magically thickened the sauce in the pan as they finished cooking. And then I made Joe Cicala’s soulful lamb ragù from Cicala at the Divine Lorraine. We traded pictures of vintage pasta cutters by text as I rolled out Joe’s relatively easy fresh egg pasta recipe, then sliced those supple sheets into wide fazzoletti ribbons. Mine weren’t as pretty as his, whose edges were cut to look like Sardinian lace. But they still made a satisfying meal. For Alice’s birthday, I headed to Moore Bros. in Pennsauken for a curbside pick-up of Corzano e Paterno’s Chianti, so we can lift a toast to her and Italy and this lovely winery almost as we planned. It’s not the same. Nothing, I think, will ever be quite the same. But a ray of hope hit my email box this week from Katiuscia Passeri, my contact at Corzano e Paterno. I’d reached out to her to see if everyone was OK, and she replied: “It is very important for all of us to feel the support of so many people all around the world. We are all safe here [at the winery]...,” she wrote. “Covid cases are decreasing. Life at the farm goes on, cheese making is in full production and we are still working a lot in the vineyards...Strongly hope to meet you next year and that you are all safe.” Attached was a picture of her piece of Tuscan paradise taken that morning. Its old farmhouse stone walls were framed by blossoming flowers, budding trees and a bright blue sky. Spring has come to Italy, even in this moment of darkness.

The clams eat this and purge themselves in the process. Drain well and rinse under cold water before cooking. Discard any clams that have already opened. Bring a large pot of well-salted water to boil the pasta. Meanwhile, get a large sauté pan with a lid to open the clams. Put the pan on medium-high, add the olive oil and then the clams. Top the clams with chopped garlic, chopped parsley, chile flakes and two teaspoons of the lemon juice. Add the wine and cover quickly. Let the clams steam and cook until they are all fully open, about 6-8 minutes. Remove cooked clams and remove the meat from most of the shells, leaving 4-5 clams per person in the shell for garnish. Reserve under foil in some of the steamed broth to keep warm and moist. Add spaghetti to pot and cook one minute shy of al dente, about six minutes. Drain pasta, and then add directly to the sauté pan with the clam juice over the heat. Add enough fresh water to the pan so the pasta is a little less than halfway covered, along with butter. Jiggle the pan to incorporate and let pasta finish cooking until al dente. It should absorb the juice and naturally thicken the sauce. Adjust seasoning for salt (carefully, since clams can be salty) add a pinch more chile, the remaining teaspoon of lemon juice, parsley and reserved clams. Toss and serve, with more parsley and grated Parmesan, if desired.

173,How Philadelphia hospitals are protecting the mental health of workers treating coronavirus,"When Francisco Aguilar is at home between shifts at Einstein Medical Center Philadelphia, he often decompresses by ordering takeout from a local restaurant or making cocktails. Aguilar, chief resident in the division of medicine, then takes pictures to document those experiences, and sends them to a WhatsApp group of fellow residents to earn “points” for taking care of his mental health. “The Health Cup is something that we came up with a little while ago, where residents split into four teams and compete to see who can earn the most points for doing wellness activities,” Aguilar said. “Like playing with your kids, for example, earns a certain number of points. Or having a movie night, FaceTiming with your friends or family, or doing a home workout.” More doctors are recognizing how important the program is because of the increased stress and fear of the coronavirus pandemic, he said. Focusing on wellness has alleviated some of those feelings for residents. “There is still fear,” Aguilar said. “But everyone is hanging in there with good spirits.” Doctors and nurses are thought to be at increased risk of contracting the coronavirus, and health-care workers already experience higher rates of depression and burnout than the general public. The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to worsen mental health issues in the industry. As a result, some Philly hospitals have introduced coronavirus-specific wellness initiatives or expanded existing programs for their employees. At Einstein, employees are offered psychological “first aid” in the virtual support sessions with psychiatrists and 24/7 hotlines for workers who might be struggling to cope. Penn Medicine created a workforce wellness committee, while Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals is offering employees yoga classes, virtual fitness sessions, and tips on how to home-school children. A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that the mental health of health-care workers in China declined as a result of treating patients with COVID-19. Mental health experts have expressed concerns about the psychological effects of the widespread lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Moral injury, defined as “perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations,” coming from the difficult decisions that doctors have to make about allocating resources and saving lives, is another concern. “Anyone on the front line at this point is working under incredible circumstances,” said Lisa Bellini, senior vice dean for academic affairs at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and the chair of Penn Medicine’s COVID-19 workforce wellness committee. “Their work and stress level is significantly greater than it usually is... Their entire support structure is disrupted. We’re not measuring burnout of our physicians, but we expect it to be 100%.” Physicians are currently in a “heroic phase” of crisis management, Bellini said, which is characterized by a high level of activity, a low level of productivity, and a sense of altruism. This will be followed by a honeymoon period, she said, which often involves feelings of community bonding and optimism that everything will return to normal quickly. “Then there’s going to be a prolonged period of disillusionment that’s going to be settling into a routine of intensity,” Bellini said. “That’s going to be challenging for front-line providers, and the mental health effects are going to be significant.” » HELP US REPORT: Are you a health care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker or other expert? We want to hear from you. To address these concerns, Penn’s workforce wellness committee, created about a week ago, has introduced resources such as free hotel rooms to rest in between shifts and limit exposure of the virus to family members at home, a search tool to help staff find drop-in child-care options, and sessions with trained coping coaches. The committee also launched a website for the public to submit messages of encouragement and gratitude, and received 450 entries in less than 24 hours. The messages and pictures are displayed on computer screens in Penn hospitals, so workers can see them. Bellini said she believes many of the new wellness programs will continue after the pandemic. ""In medicine, the self-care bucket has always been the smallest, but maybe the challenges we are facing will lead to improvements there,” she said. To Glenn Eiger, program director of Einstein’s internal medicine and preliminary medicine residency programs, communication is key. From the outset of the pandemic, he established clear lines of communication with the 93 residents he oversees. Each day, Eiger holds two video meetings to update his team with everything he knows and to answer any questions. “I always start with a little bit of reflection, letting them know how I feel about what’s going on, how I’m coping,” he said. “I think they appreciate hearing an honest story about what’s happening at the hospital. And I answer whatever they ask me honestly. If I don’t know the answer, I try to find out from other people and get back to them.” Eiger asked all of his chief residents to check in with their trainees on a daily basis through either a text or a call. He tries to convey to his team that “this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint.” And when Eiger gets a chance, he tries to post happy news, such as birthday wishes or photos from a virtual happy hour, on the program’s Facebook page. “It’s super-intense what they do now,” he said. “We’re just trying to preserve normalcy as best we can. Honestly, if programs think about wellness and support their residents through one of the most incredible experiences of their medical careers, they may be the best future physicians the world has ever seen.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,ERERWUE2Y5GCBLO27RV5KBUCZM
174,Comcast commits $500 million to help its workers affected by coronavirus; top execs donate salary,"Comcast committed $500 million to support its workers during the coronavirus crisis, and the company’s top executives will donate their salaries to charities supporting COVID-19 relief efforts. In an email to employees, Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts said Wednesday that the $500 million would provide continued pay and benefits to employees where operations have stalled or been harmed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Philadelphia media giant, which has 190,000 employees worldwide, was forced to shut down theme parks, delay movie releases, and suspend content production because of the outbreak. It must also wait a year to broadcast the Olympic games in Tokyo, which were set to give the company more than $1.25 billion in advertising revenue. Roberts, CFO Mike Cavanagh, Comcast Cable CEO David Watson, NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, and Jeremy Darroch, the CEO of the Sky European pay TV service, will donate their salaries “for the duration of this situation,” the memo said. The memo did not say which charities would receive the donations. “We hope in some small way we can make this time easier on our employees, our local communities and our customers,” Roberts wrote. Comcast did not say how many employees would benefit from the $500 million Employee Disaster Assistance Fund. Roberts earned a salary of nearly $3.2 million in 2018, according to the most recent compensation disclosure. Cavanagh collected almost $2 million that year, while Watson made more than $1.5 million. Shell, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, replaced former NBCUniversal head Stephen Burke, who made nearly $3 million. When including other compensation, such as stock options and bonuses, Roberts made $35 million in 2018. Cavanagh earned $21.7 million, Watson made $14.7 million, and Burke raked in nearly $40 million that year. Separately, with more people working and studying from home due to the coronavirus outbreak, Comcast is giving customers unlimited data for no additional charge and making its vast network of Xfinity WiFi hot spots free for everyone. The company has also pledged that it won’t disconnect service or impose late fees if customers can’t pay their bills during the pandemic. Last week, Roberts’ family gave $5 million to help pay for 50,000 Chromebooks for students in the Philadelphia School District.

The order will remain in effect through April 30, but it is still hard to tell when the peak might hit. 🚇 SEPTA is making changes to services, like rear-door boarding, suspension of onboard fare payment, and rider limits, but workers are still asking for better protections. 👮 Advocates are asking the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to release vulnerable youth from detention centers and jails. 🎾 Wimbledon has been canceled. It is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and this is the first time it has been canceled since World War II. 📈As of Wednesday evening, there are more than 3,900 reported cases in the Philadelphia area. Track the spread here. Gov. Tom Wolf extended his coronavirus stay-at-home order to all 12.8 million Pennsylvanians. Almost all counties in the state have confirmed coronavirus cases. Today, state health officials reported 962 new cases, the largest single-day increase. “This virus is spreading rapidly. It’s in every corner of our state. It’s gotten into our nursing homes and our prisons. And it’s filling up our hospital beds,” Wolf said in announcing the order, which will remain in effect through April 30. “Every day we wait, the coronavirus spreads further and becomes more difficult to suppress. We need to act now."" Here is a full list of what you can and can’t do under the stay-at-home order and which businesses are allowed to remain open. Until now, Wolf implemented the stay-at-home order gradually, targeting counties hardest-hit by the virus.  The shutdowns are already having a significant effect on the economy. Tax revenues fell 6 percent short of what the state had been estimated to collect last month. “It is critical that we follow all the mitigation and the prevention efforts and the stay at home orders,” said Health Secretary Rachel Levine. “If we do not do this correctly, then there is going to be a significant surge of patients” that could overwhelm hospitals. The first of the month is usually went rent is due and today marks the first time these payments are up since the coronavirus has closed businesses and forced people out of jobs, brought financial instability, and compromised their health. This is especially tough in Philadelphia, the poorest big city in America. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in a service sector that has been shut down by the stay-at-home order. More than 830,000 Pennsylvanians applied for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of March, which is more than the total for all of 2019. Local and state governments have instituted moratoriums on eviction, landlords are trying to work with tenants, and utilities have suspended shutoffs. Renters are protected from eviction through at least April 30 while Pennsylvania courts are shut down. New Jersey evictions are on hold through most of May. For some it isn’t enough, my colleague Anna Orso reports. They are turning to crowdfunding to pay their bills, organizing with fellow tenants to negotiate rent reductions, or calling for a massive rent strike.

177,Gov. Tom Wolf extends coronavirus stay-at-home order to all of Pennsylvania,"Spotlight PA is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and PennLive/Patriot-News. Sign up for our free weekly newsletter. As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers.  HARRISBURG — As the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday extended his stay-at-home order to all 12.8 million people in the state. “This virus is spreading rapidly. It’s in every corner of our state. It’s gotten into our nursing homes and our prisons. And it’s filling up our hospital beds,” Wolf said in announcing the order, which will remain in effect through April 30. “Every day we wait, the coronavirus spreads further and becomes more difficult to suppress. We need to act now,” he added. Wolf’s move to enact a statewide order comes as COVID-19 continues its unrelenting spread into more counties. On Wednesday, state health officials reported 962 new cases, the largest single-day increase, bringing the statewide total to 5,805. Sixty of the state’s 67 counties have confirmed cases, and 74 people have died after becoming infected with the virus. Among the infected: 286 health care workers and 200 nursing home residents. “It is critical that we follow all the mitigation and the prevention efforts and the stay-at-home orders,” Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Wednesday, adding: “If we do not do this correctly, then there is going to be a significant surge of patients” that could overwhelm hospitals.  Over the past week, Wolf had issued stay-at-home orders for counties where the virus’ spread was most acute. As of Tuesday, 33 counties were on that list, covering large swaths of the state. But the governor had stopped short of a statewide order, saying he wanted to take a measured approach to limiting people’s movements. The governor has so far opted against enforcement of the orders, relying instead on voluntary compliance. He reiterated that stance Wednesday, saying all Pennsylvanians “have a vested interest in staying home.” “I am optimistic that people across the state will comply and remain in their homes,” he said. “We will all work together in this. It’s our only choice.” Under a stay-at-home order, residents are urged to only leave their homes for items that are essential for living. They can go out to buy groceries for themselves, family members, or as a volunteer effort; take a walk, hike, or run, as long as they practice social distancing; or care for family members or pets in another household. Also permitted is travel to care for seniors and people with disabilities. Travel to or from schools or other educational institutions to obtain meals or pick up materials for distance learning is also allowed. Since the first cases of coronavirus were reported in Pennsylvania on March 6, the governor has shut down schools statewide and ordered all but “life-sustaining” businesses to close their physical operations. The closures have taken a toll, with the state’s economy already taking a beating. Officials from the Department of Revenue said Wednesday that tax revenues fell 6% short of what the state had been estimated to collect in March. That trend is widely expected to continue — and accelerate — in the coming months, especially if businesses begin to close and more people lose their jobs. And the state’s unemployment compensation system is already buckling under the weight of a sudden and steep surge in claims. In the last two weeks in March, more than 830,000 Pennsylvanians applied for unemployment benefits — a number that surpassed the total for all of 2019. 100% ESSENTIAL: Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

178,Physician practices are looking for ways to weather the financial storm of coronavirus,"Delaware County dermatologist Joseph Laskas normally sees 130 patients a week. Now he’s down to five or six patients a week since commerce — including wide swaths of the health-care industry — screeched to a halt last month amid measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “It’s a huge decrease,"" said Laskas, who is one of 10 doctors at Dermatology Ltd., which employs 53 in offices in Media and Glen Mills. ""For all intents and purposes, the business is closed, except for everybody’s still on payroll.” The practice is looking at every angle for financial relief and wants to keep paying employees. “So far we’ve been doing that, but it can’t go on forever,” Laskas said. Physician practices like the one where Laskas works employ 55,000 people in the Philadelphia region, and the coronavirus pandemic is hammering them financially, because all non-urgent medical care is being postponed indefinitely to prevent the spread of the virus. Hospitals are facing a similar squeeze, with revenues and volumes down in the 40% range, according to sources. But most of those institutions are better equipped financially to handle the slowdown than physician practices, typically small businesses that lack the reserves to pay bills for long without money coming in. » HELP US REPORT: Are you a health care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker or other expert? We want to hear from you. The pandemic is going to lay bare “the chasm of haves and have-nots in our health system,” said Lynda Mischel, a principal at Veralon, a Philadelphia-based health-care consulting firm. Large practices have the advantage of huge pools of patients that will help them come back when the crisis passes. Smaller practices will have a harder time recovering, Mischel said. “They have probably by and large laid off their staffs or furloughed their staffs, and financially are in a lot of trouble,"" she said. ""They have rent to pay.” For all talk of how telemedicine has come into its own, the method looks much different to a specialist in a small practice than it does to a doctor employed by a large system. University health systems such as Jefferson and the University of Pennsylvania are still able to pay doctors’ salaries because they have a lot of reserves and endowments, said Brian Broker, one of six physicians at ENT & Allergy Specialists, which has four offices in Philadelphia’s western suburbs. “We have none of those things,"" Broker said. “We’re private groups. The doctors are all living on their savings because we’re not going to do enough televisits to take a salary.” Revenue is down more than 90% at ENT & Allergy Specialists, Broker said, because most of it comes from procedures and tests for hearing, allergies and breathing, along with infusions, injections, and endoscopies. “An office visit is a teeny piece of it,"" Broker said. “Now, you’ve taken all those procedures away. Plus, you’ve taken at least three-quarters of the volume away. Now we’re down to just one quarter of the least revenue-generating portion of what we do.” ENT & Allergy Specialists had 40 employees. Now it’s down to 10, Broker said. The practice is looking at loan programs it might be eligible for, such as the Paycheck Protection Program created by the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act . The loans are limited to companies with fewer than 500 employees, and the loans will be forgiven if certain requirements are met, such as continuing to pay employees. For ENT & Allergy Specialists, “the question is, can we bring them back?"" Broker said. ""It’s one thing if we had the payroll support, but we still can’t bring them back if we don’t have any volume.” Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia and other large groups were left out of the massive CARES stimulus package, said Mark Victor, CCP’s chief executive. CCP has 570 employees spread across 36 offices, which means it’s a little too large to be eligible for the Payroll Protection Program. So far, CCP has kept paying staff. To do so, physicians gave up their paychecks, Victor said. “That’s going to be hard to maintain for any long period of time.” Like most specialty practices, CCP is bringing in just a fraction of its normal revenue because virtually all testing is being postponed, including ultrasounds to see how well a patient’s heart is working and cardiac catheterizations to diagnose and treat heart disease, Victor said. Despite the disruption, Victor said he is enthusiastic about how telephone visits with patients have gone over the last three weeks. “I firmly believe that this will persist long after this crisis goes away,” he said. If a telephone visit reveals that a patient needs to see a doctor, the patient goes to one of CCP’s six triage centers. “We’re having people literally wait in their car” to make sure only one person at a time is in the office, Victor said. Similarly, at Meetinghouse Family Physicians, a three-doctor primary-care practice in Marlton, only one patient at a time is allowed in the waiting room, said Sloan Robinson, a doctor there. Patient volume is down significantly since Meetinghouse postponed all routine visits, but patients still need a place to go sometimes, Robinson said. On Thursday, he saw an older woman with blood in her urine. “She’s got to be seen,"" Robinson said. ""You can’t pat her on the back, and you don’t want to send her to the emergency room.” It’s a tough time for the entire community, Robinson said: “It’s a strain on the practice. It’s a strain on the families that allow their people to work here.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,RXHAOKYYHVAVPHY4ESOCKD4LWI
179,"Snicker if you want, but I plan to wear a face mask until the coronavirus pandemic has subsided | Jenice Armstrong","My husband went in the basement and rummaged around awhile before he emerged carrying an old face mask. “Aren’t you glad I save everything,” he said as he handed it over. It was old and dusty. He’d worn it a few years ago while tearing up old carpet in a rental unit we were renovating. But since we’re in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and there’s a nationwide shortage of protective gear, it didn’t hold the same ick factor for me that it normally might have. Plus, unlike a standard surgical mask, which many folks have been wearing, this model was somewhat snug around my nose. It was better than nothing, I figured. I wore it when we ventured out on Monday to the Costco in Mount Laurel. My plan was to get in and out of that enormous warehouse store as quickly as possible. I was pushing my grocery basket through the freezer section when I noticed a middle-aged guy laughing and looking in my direction. I probably looked a little strange with the hood of my pink rain jacket covering my head and a mask covering my mouth and nose. He said, “They say you’re only supposed to wear that if you’re infected with the coronavirus or caring for someone who has it."" I had heard the same thing and started to tell him as much, but I didn’t have to because his wife shot back, “That’s what they say.” Indeed. Experts are divided about whether it makes sense for us to wear masks to help protect against catching the coronavirus, which can be spread through contaminated droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Initially, authorities told us not to wear surgical and N-95 masks because they are in such short supply and desperately needed by health-care workers. But now it looks as if that thinking is shifting. According to the Washington Post, authorities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are considering changing official guidance to encourage people to cover their faces. Earlier this week, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, said the task force also is discussing whether to change its recommendation. Besides, some experts think it’s not a bad idea to cover your face with even a bandanna. “My opinion is YES we should be wearing masks in public. Four out of five people … did not know that they had the virus when they spread it to others,"" Dr. Ala Stanford, founder of the R.E.A.L. Concierge Medicine Co., told me via email Tuesday. ""The mask does confer some prevention of spread and transmission of disease. The mask prevents your respiratory droplets, somewhat, from landing on a surface, someone’s body part, or the air. “At this point, we only have something to gain, and everything to lose, by not instituting mask wearing, and that is more lives,” added Stanford, an adult and pediatric surgeon. ""We are in catch-up, reactive mode, not preventative. This measure should help and we need incoming help from all sects of our nation to combat this deadly virus.” Still, there’s a worry that masks provide a false sense of security that might encourage people to stop practicing social distancing. Then, there’s the very real risk that consumers will start hoarding them. Please don’t do that. You can make your own masks or tie something around your face. “The danger in requiring masks or encouraging them through social pressure is that we don’t have enough supplies to protect everyone,” pointed out Katie Foss, the author of Constructing the Outbreak: Media in Epidemics and Collective Memory. ""Health professionals and others need them to do their essential jobs safely more than average, healthy people for brief trips. "" I thought of all of that as I headed out to shop. If anything, wearing a mask reminded me that we are in the midst of a pandemic and not to touch my face.

180,A Pa. congressman said the U.S. coronavirus trajectory is more like South Korea than Italy. Is that true?,"Last week, U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick spoke about the coronavirus pandemic on a local talk radio show, and he told the host that the outbreak in this country looks more like the one in South Korea than the one in Italy. “We’ve got to give the American public a rough estimate of how long we think this is going to take, based mostly on the South Korean model, which seems to be the trajectory that we are on, thankfully, and not the Italian model,” the Republican congressman from Bucks County said on The Dom Giordano Program. We wondered how the spread of the coronavirus in the United States compares with the spread of the disease in other parts of the world. When Fitzpatrick made those remarks, he was comparing the three countries’ case fatality rates, said Will Kiley, his spokesperson. That’s “the key metric we’re all watching,” he added. Fitzpatrick is right that the fatality rate in the United States roughly matches South Korea’s and is far lower than Italy’s. But Drexel epidemiologist Michael LeVasseur cautioned against reading too much into those numbers. The virus appears to be deadlier in Italy because the population there is older, and elderly coronavirus patients are the most likely to die. For example, 23% of people in Italy are over age 65, compared with only 14% in South Korea and 16% in the U.S. The age-specific case fatality rates in the three countries are about the same, LeVasseur said. He also pointed out that the curve epidemiologists keep talking about depicts the number of coronavirus patients and hospitals’ capacity to care for them — not deaths caused by the virus. “Flattening the curve” means slowing the virus’ rate of transmission and reducing the number of new cases so that fewer sick people need to seek treatment all at once. The latest data on coronavirus cases show that South Korea did flatten the curve, while case counts in the United States and Italy keep climbing. Another way to compare the virus’ impact in the three countries is to look at their economies. Fitzpatrick’s comments came amid a discussion with Giordano about the economic pain the virus has already inflicted on Pennsylvania business owners, and how much longer the closures ordered by Gov. Tom Wolf might last. The congressman argued that businesses need to know when things will go back to normal if they have any hope of surviving this crisis. In South Korea, businesses have remained open even as the country fights the virus, whereas in Italy, businesses have been closed for weeks. The latest modeling suggests the outbreak will peak in the United States in two weeks. But that doesn’t mean that Pennsylvania businesses should necessarily expect to reopen by May, said Nate Wardel, a spokesperson for the State Department of Health. The scarcity of coronavirus tests and the time it takes to get results remain the biggest hurdles to relaxing restrictions. Asked whether Wolf would use the state’s case fatality rate to determine when businesses may reopen, Wardle said it would be one of several metrics used to make that call. And no, he said, the similarity between the fatality rate in the United States and South Korea doesn’t mean Pennsylvania is ready for South Korea-style normalcy. Fitzpatrick said the spread of the coronavirus in the United States matches the spread of the virus in South Korea, not Italy. The U.S. and South Korea have similar case fatality rates — Italy’s is higher — but all three countries have age-specific mortality rates that are about the same. In addition, public health experts say the fatality rate wouldn’t be the only or the most important metric used to determine when businesses may reopen.

181,"N.J. reports 72 more coronavirus deaths; Philadelphia adds 5, and it’s still uncertain when the peak might hit","New Jersey added 72 coronavirus deaths to its rapidly rising total on Tuesday, Philadelphia reported five more fatalities, and officials say they still can’t be sure when the wave of the pandemic might crest in the region and the nation. The Garden State’s case total was approaching 19,000, with 270 virus-related deaths, 72 of those reported on Tuesday, officials said. At least 67 deaths have occurred in Pennsylvania, which has just under 6,000 cases. At least 53 have died in the Philadelphia region. Pennsylvania hasn’t seen “quite the exponential rise and the doubling that we had seen before in certain areas,” said Rachel Levine, the state health commissioner, adding that it might be the result of social distancing. But she said it was too early to tell if the trend would continue. She warned that in forecasting the arc of the outbreak, so many variables are in play that computer models are bedeviled by some of the same problems they have in predicting the future of a snowstorm. We are all familiar with how that can turn out. The White House said Tuesday that the U.S. coronavirus-related death toll could range from 100,000 to 250,000, based on models. “We are in a global pandemic,"" Levine said. ""This is an emergency. Under these circumstances, please stay at home.” Similarly, Gov. Phil Murphy urged New Jerseyans to “stay at home before it hits home.” The pandemic’s impacts have been almost unimaginably wide-ranging and the psychological effects immeasurable, as the region, like most of the rest of the country, confronts at least 30 more days with the business of life in suspension. Some blocks in Center City, weathering the worsening economic crisis, appeared braced for a hurricane Tuesday, with liquor stores and restaurants, even an upscale cosmetic shop, blocking off windows and doors with sheets of wood. Both Pennsylvania and New Jersey have acquired “major disaster” declarations, which could loosen significant streams of federal dollars. But it remains uncertain how the money will be allocated. Responding to a pandemic is hardly standard fare for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the nation’s disaster agency; this is far more insidious, elusive, and complicated than a weather disaster. For millions of schoolchildren and their parents, the rhythms of the school year have been hopelessly disrupted. In a surreal turn, the Philadelphia School District announced Tuesday that students and staff would get their spring break next week, even though schools have been closed indefinitely. “I understand that this will not look or feel like a traditional spring break,"" Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. wrote to parents, “but we do want to recognize that our educators need time with their families and away from work.” He said that he expected virtual instruction to begin April 13, and that principals would be contacting families about the distribution of loaner Chromebooks for those who need them. Hite has said he expects instruction to begin the following week, by April 17. The state announced that starting next week, school districts can apply for grants to buy laptops or other materials for online instruction, with priority given to schools that have the most need. Meanwhile, the ranks of the furloughed continue to swell. As of Friday, new unemployment claims in Pennsylvania reached 830,000 — surpassing the total for all of last year. In another sign of these extreme times, Philadelphia police are warning they are seeing an increase of car break-ins by thieves seeking items that have disappeared from store shelves — the likes of bottled water and cleaning products. For the region’s religious communities, this year’s Holy Week and Passover observances, which would begin next week, will be like no others, as houses of worship won’t be able to hold conventional services until at least the first week of May. All Catholic churches have suspended regular Masses; however, several people who attended a livestreamed Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul on Sunday lined up to receive Holy Communion, with the wafers placed on their tongues. The Rev. Dennis Gill, director of the archdiocese’s Office of Divine Worship, defended the practice: “That’s the traditional way of receiving Holy Communion."" The archdiocese, however, may be having second thoughts. “The whole idea is to prevent the gathering of people — that’s what we’re trying to avoid,” Gill said. “And if that’s still happening, we may need to reevaluate the policy.” And the outbreak has changed the rules at area nursing homes. New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said that more than 80 of the state’s 375 long-term care facilities now have a positive coronavirus patient. She is ordering all individuals entering nursing homes and long-term care facilities to wear masks, and for seniors to wear them when receiving care from staff. Persichilli said that a little less than half the state’s residents who have died were over 80. In Philadelphia, which reported five deaths Tuesday, half of the 14 coronavirus-related fatalities have occurred in nursing homes, according to Health Commissioner Thomas Farley. He said that an increasing number of cases have occurred among African Americans. To enforce social-distancing rules, the city is authorizing police officers to issue disorderly conduct or failure-to-disperse citations to those who violate Mayor Jim Kenney’s stay-at-home order, Managing Director Brian Abernathy announced Tuesday. Both infractions could carry fines of $100, Kenney spokesperson Mike Dunn said. The city had hoped that it wouldn’t come to this, that it could persuade people to cooperate, or rely on police to break up outdoor gatherings informally. However, violations in some neighborhoods, including Kensington, forced the city to alter its strategy, Abernathy said. City officials also say that those who want to report violations of social distancing orders may call 311. In New Jersey, 24 people have been arrested for violating the order prohibiting large gatherings, according to Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal. The region did receive some encouraging words from a local celebrity. He kept his social distance, but the internet’s favorite mascot, Gritty, emerged with a social media message Tuesday. “I recognize there’s a lot going on, and I rightfully assume my duty to be the orange light of hope in this COVID-19 covered world,"" he wrote.

This opens up millions of dollars of federal assistance to get through the pandemic and its effects. New Jersey was declared a major disaster area last week. 🏥 Today was New Jersey’s deadliest day yet, with 69 more people dying from the coronavirus. This brings the statewide death total to 267, Gov. Phil Murphy said. The national death count surpassed China today, showing how the coronavirus is spreading throughout the country. 👮Philadelphia cops can issue citations and $100 fines for people who violate the stay-at-home order, which limits outings to life-sustaining activities, like buying food or seeking medical care. You are allowed to walk or run outside as long as you stay at least six feet apart from others. ✈️ Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Americans who are abroad need to return immediately, or they risk being stuck where they are. 📈As of Tuesday evening, there are more than 3,000 reported cases in the Philadelphia area. Track the spread here. While the CDC has been recommending that sick people wear masks, that guidance has not extended to people without symptoms. But we now know the coronavirus can be spread even by people who do not seem to be sick and several nations that have either required masks or implemented mask-wearing campaigns have seen success in controlling the spread of the virus. The CDC is now considering revising that guidance, my colleague Anna Orso reports. The coronavirus is spread through droplets of bodily fluids that can escape from the mouth and nose. If someone who is infected is wearing a mask, they’re less likely to pass the infection on to someone else, physician and former Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Face the Nation. “We have seen this virus affect healthy people, so I can’t tell who has it and who does not have it,” said Judith J. Lightfoot, chief of infectious disease at Rowan University’s School of Osteopathic Medicine said.  Still, scientists and physicians do not all agree. Some think that widespread mask-wearing could wrongly encourage people to leave their homes for unnecessary trips. “I think it’s really important that people might not become complacent [if] they have a homemade mask on,” Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said last week. If you are interested in making your own mask, my colleague Nick Vadala explains how to do it.  We’ve known for months that “underlying conditions” can raise your risk of getting harder hit by the coronavirus, but we haven’t known just how much. The first comprehensive U.S. numbers were published today, showing that for those with heart, lung, and kidney problems, the consequences of getting sick is much worse, my colleague Tom Avril reports. The newly released CDC study of 7,162 infected patients shows only 2.2% of people without underlying conditions needed ICU treatment. But the outcomes were significantly different for patients with diabetes, chronic lung disease, heart disease and kidney disease. Even though this represents the first large-scale study of hospitalized coronavirus patients in this country, the authors cautioned that the data were incomplete and said the percentages would change. 🐶 Union carpenters create free custom doghouses for the Pennsylvania SPCA. 🎥 All of Philly has a ‘Witness’ story to tell, as you told us in One Movie, One Philadelphia this weekend. 🏒 Gritty is on an Instagram Live ‘vision quest,’ continuing his mission of being ‘an orange light of hope.' Food distributors usually sell products like produce, meat, seafood, and vegetables to restaurants, but now restaurants are closed. A half-dozen of those companies are still operating though, opting to sell their food directly to customers. “This is chef-grade food,” said Jim Sorkin, whose family owns Julius Silvert Inc., a fourth-generation distributor in North Philadelphia that usually serves high-end restaurants. My colleague Michael Klein compiled a list of distributors offering to sell directly to customers. There are less-expensive packages like a fruits, vegetables, dairy, and nuts mix, as well as meat boxes. See the full list here. Have a social distancing tip or question to share?

Yes, the stay-at-home orders and business closures have left many people struggling, but others with greater financial stability and health are using this time to finally do something they have been meaning to do. They may be repairing a classic car or a fractured relationship, learning yoga, baking, or sewing. After Dan McVay’s father died in August 2016, he left behind two unfinished models of boats.

The team informed ticket holders that it is indefinitely postponing future payments on season tickets. The second payment on tickets was due April 16. That one and all future payment installments will be pushed back until the crisis has subsided. The first payment installment was March 16. Eagles president Don Smolenski told The Inquirer that the organization decided to postpone future payments shortly after that. “The timing of future payments will be determined and communicated at a later date,"" the Eagles said in an email sent to their season-ticket holders. “We are closely monitoring developments and will evaluate every option to ensure that you have the flexibility to make your scheduled payments within a reasonable time. “As an organization, we want you to know that we are here for you and we want to be supportive of you during this difficult time.""

184,Trump’s coronavirus response will protect Pennsylvania’s blue-collar workers | Opinion,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak first reached U.S. shores, the Trump administration has taken proactive steps to limit America’s exposure to the virus while working with Congress to give working families the financial support they need to weather the economic consequences of this global crisis. While measures such as restricting travel from coronavirus hot spots and limiting nonessential activities are vital to protect the country, they also have direct economic consequences for working Americans. Businesses — including the small businesses that employ almost half the country’s private-sector workforce — can’t survive very long without a source of revenue. This problem is becoming increasingly widespread as states across the country, including Pennsylvania, have ordered nonessential establishments to close for at least several weeks. The president’s authorization of direct cash payments to Americans, which will provide most working families with an invaluable financial buffer in these uncertain times, is about to take effect. I wholeheartedly support this proposal, which will give the typical family of four a vital $3,400 buffer. The federal government will also provide an additional $600 per week in unemployment compensation to help eligible workers laid off during this crisis up to July 31. The unprecedented coronavirus relief bill will also provide hundreds of billions of dollars in low-interest loans to small businesses, ensuring that workers will have jobs to return to once it’s safe to leave home. Businesses that retain their workforce and rehire any employees who have been laid off won’t have to repay those loans — a powerful incentive for employers. We need to get Pennsylvania back to where it was economically before the COVID-19 crisis. Pennsylvania had its lowest unemployment rate in decades, dipping to just 4.1% at one point during the last two years, just above our state’s historic low. Under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the country was seeing the best economy in our lifetime. Now, given the president’s stewardship, we can turn this around. Unlike the 2008 recession, which was caused by systemic policy disincentives to economic growth, this pandemic can be beaten through mitigation efforts, repurposing manufacturers to produce urgently needed products like ventilators, and moving forward with construction and other parts of the economy while adhering to Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. Here in Pennsylvania, members of the General Assembly convened last week for a historic voting session. For the first time since 1682, members of our body could vote remotely in order to recognize social distancing while maintaining a functioning democracy. Along with Gov. Tom Wolf, the General Assembly enacted new laws last week in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To sync with the federal changes, we modified our unemployment compensation laws by suspending the one week waiting period before Pennsylvanians can collect benefits, as well as the job search requirement. We also provided employers with relief from charges for those employers who have had to furlough employees through no fault of their own. Further, we authorized the Pennsylvania Secretary of Labor and Industry to enact temporary regulations needed to access federal funds. To do our part in providing necessary personal protective equipment for our frontline health-care providers, we appropriated $50 million to purchase medical supplies and equipment. In addition, we have been working to identify both available supplies of personal protective equipment and manufacturers in Pennsylvania who can retool their assembly lines to produce personal protective equipment. We are also urging the governor to allow construction sites to open again. I am introducing HB 2400 to allow public and private construction activities that can adhere to social distancing practices and other mitigation measures defined by the CDC to protect workers. Highway and other open-air infrastructure projects, for instance, could easily be completed without requiring workers to come within six feet of each other. On March 19, Pennsylvania became the first state to shut down all active public and private construction sites, while issuing selective waivers on an ad hoc basis. There is no consistency. Pennsylvanians should be assured that their elected officials at all levels, from President Trump to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, are working to provide the necessary tools to combat COVID-19 together and turn the economy back into the robust engine it was. Mike Turzai is the speaker of Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives.

185,Consistent messaging from leaders is key to quelling coronavirus in Pa. and N.J. | Editorial,"Should we punish people who defy stay-at-home orders and the mandates of social distancing? And if so, how? Now that human interaction has become potentially fatal, states have responded with various levels of lockdowns and prohibitions on gatherings, and yet some are ignoring these mandates and gathering, or operating businesses anyway. Depending on where you are, that could be especially fatal. For example, with New Jersey’s more than 18,000 cases among the highest in the nation — Bergen County alone has nearly 3,000 — Gov. Phil Murphy and top law enforcement officials have taken aggressive steps. Statewide, police had responded to more than 70 incidents that led to individuals being warned, cited, or in a few cases, arrested for violating limits on private and public gatherings or offenses related to the epidemic. Last Saturday, police reported finding more than 40 people crammed into a tiny Ewing Township, Mercer County, apartment for a “corona party” featuring a DJ. The person responsible was charged with five counts of child endangerment. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city would be imposing fines of up to $500 to those defying social distancing rules. We don’t believe this virus should create a new class of criminal. On the other hand, enforcement lets people know how serious it is to minimize exposure. Elected and law enforcement officials should think creatively about how to best enforce the coronavirus prohibitions, such as creating steps of violations, with fines increasing according to the level of risk gatherings might create. At the same time, local governments are often offering confusing, unclear directives on how people should be living their lives. Shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, and lockdowns are all relatively new terms in our civic vocabularies, and leaders need to make sure people understand the differences and send consistent messages. For example, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is strongly encouraging people to stay home; at the same time, the city announced it has closed MLK Drive to vehicular traffic so people can use it to exercise. Most New Jersey parks remain open, although playgrounds and active recreational spaces are locked down. Some restrictions have been tailored to local conditions. Hoboken, N.J., with 42,502 people per square mile, has imposed a curfew and closed its parks. Local parks also have been shut down in Bergen County. Far more drastic measures have been imposed in authoritarian China and even in democratic Spain, where surveillance drones have been deployed. France now requires citizens to carry a form to justify why they are leaving the house. Draconian measures won’t be necessary if we accept that the current limits on some ordinary activities is a way to end the crisis. The orders issued by the city and by the state of Pennsylvania, as well as the state of New Jersey, could best be summarized as: Please stay at home unless absolutely necessary. Those insisting that normal life must go on need to remember that the people they could be infecting with a potentially fatal disease also deserve to have life go on — literally.

186,Question for Trump: Where is the testing data we need to curb coronavirus and get back to work? | Trudy Rubin,"Back in the 1950s, the TV show Dragnet’s Sgt. Joe Friday famously advised witnesses: “Just the facts, ma’am.” That phrase became a national slogan, long before the very concept of “facts” was clouded by social media. As the number of coronavirus cases soars, with Americans anxious to know when stay-at-home orders will end, we desperately need the facts, based on reliable data. Instead, we are deluged with COVID-19 misinformation from the White House and all over the world. No one should be surprised that Russia and China are promoting the online lie that the virus is a U.S. bioweapon. They are also playing on America’s political divisions over the virus while hiding their own egregious errors and their true number of cases. More disturbing is the tsunami of fake facts on the home front. President Donald Trump continues to spin medical misinformation daily, along with attacks on scientists or governors who question his handling of the virus. This feeds into the far right’s endless conspiracy theories, the latest being the claim that Anthony Fauci is part of a secret cabal to undermine Trump. Even the sainted Fauci — who, with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has become the voice of reason on COVID-19 — can’t give us the necessary answers because the U.S. still doesn’t have the data. And we don’t have the data because we still aren’t doing enough testing. We aren’t doing enough testing because the testing process has become bogged down in partisan politics. President Trump says one million tests have now been done in the country. But we still lag many countries in per capita testing. And there’s no sign the White House has developed a nationwide policy of representative random sampling, including in geographical areas that still appear to have few cases. “I’ve heard nothing from epidemiologists or schools of public health to corroborate those numbers or this level of testing,” says public health expert David Katz, founding director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. “If the data are available, where are they? They should be in the public domain.” “We need representative random sampling of given populations for infections and immune status,” Katz told me. Without sampling asymptomatic populations, he says, scientists can’t know how widespread the disease is, how many have recovered, and whether we can transfer antibodies. They can’t know to what extent those without symptoms transfer the disease, or what percentage of younger people get infected. They can’t stop new hot spots from emerging after we come out of hiding. Equally important, without the testing data, scientists can’t map out a middle path between self-isolating and getting back to normal life too quickly. Last month, Katz wrote a widely noted New York Times op-ed titled, “Is Our Fight Against Coronavirus Worse Than the Disease?,” which some believe encouraged Trump to advocate the lifting of self-isolation by Easter. That is a misunderstanding of his thesis, Katz says. His point: Only with representative random sampling can we determine if it’s safe for the healthy under-50 population to return to work relatively soon, while the at-risk populations self-isolate for longer. “This would establish a timeline to get back to life as we know it,” he says. It would also avoid prolonging a growing economic crisis that will adversely affect public health. Ideally, the government would convene public health teams to collect the data all across the country and assist with contact tracing. They would test populations without signs of the virus. The data and methods would be made transparent. Instead, we still have a fractured state-by-state system, with no national strategy for testing, even if new, faster tests come online soon. Without the data, we will be sheltering-in-place for much longer. Yet, astonishingly, President Trump said Monday, “I haven’t heard about testing being a problem.” Even as several governors were telling him they still were short of test kits. He has slammed the beleaguered governors of Michigan and Washington as “that woman” and a “snake.” The testing process remains mired in partisan politics, as Trump disses Democratic governors while favoring Republicans like Florida’s Ron DeSantis. A chaotic White House seems unable to lead the nation as a whole. Cuomo promoted the right approach (after Trump falsely attacked him over his desperate demand for more ventilators). “I’m not going to engage in politics [on the coronavirus]. It’s anti-American,” said the governor. “We are at war. There is no red and blue, it’s red, white, and blue.” Without the Cuomo approach, the White House can’t return the country to normal in the near term. It can’t amass the data we need to get back to work before we, and the economy, go bonkers. It can’t provide the public, irrespective of political party, with the facts to set us free.

188,Philly will use a Roxborough warehouse rent-free as part of its coronavirus food response,"Philadelphia officials have taken up the owner of a soon-to-be brewery in Roxborough on its offer of two free months of rent for the city’s coronavirus response. The city will use the 130,000 square feet of newly renovated space at 401 Domino Lane for food distribution to those left in need by the coronavirus pandemic, according to owner Alliance Partners HSP. The Bryn Mawr-based landlord said earlier this month that it would make the space available for free for responses to the health emergency until its future full-time tenant, Boston-based Night Shift Brewing, will begin its lease later in the spring. Philadelphia officials plan to use the space as a central repository for their food-bank efforts, Alliance HSP said Monday. “We wanted to be proactive and do whatever we could to help the city of Philadelphia address this crisis,"" said Rich Previdi, an Alliance HSP managing partner. ""We believe we really are all in this together.” In North Philadelphia, Temple University is also making space on its campus available to the city at no cost for use as overflow hospital space if needed during the crisis, Mayor Jim Kenney said last week.

189,Russian trolls politicized vaccines in 2016. Could coronavirus be next?,"In November 2016, @ameliebaldwin, supposedly a conservative Christian, tweeted: “Holistic doctors found #autism-causing carcinogens in #vaccines before being murdered.” Another user, @imissobama, who identified as black, wrote: “The anti-vax movement can only exist bc few living Americans can recall what polio actually did to ppl. I fear the same is true of fascism.” Both were later found to be Russian trolls, the Twitter accounts owned and operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency, a company that worked with Moscow to influence the 2016 U.S. election. The creators of the Russian accounts used opinions on vaccines to create believable personas and reinforced misinformation about them to susceptible demographics, pushing voters toward Donald Trump and away from Hillary Clinton, according to a new study from the University of Pennsylvania, the University at Buffalo, and Georgia State University. “The goal of these trolls was to influence the 2016 election, and vaccines were just a step in the way to bolster the reliability of these characters,” said Yotam Ophir, a coauthor of the study and professor of media at Buffalo. “They polarized vaccine information based on your political identity, [but] health topics should be decided based on science, not political party.” The research was published this week in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which Ophir said is already becoming politicized, with views on how seriously to take the crisis often falling along party lines. Ophir said Russia could use misinformation about the virus in a similar way to further the divide. “From what I see, and I see it all across the world, not just in the United States, it seems like the coronavirus is consistently being framed as a political issue. We don’t want a situation where liberals believe the risk is real and stay home, but the conservatives don’t because it’s a liberal scheme,"" Ophir said. ""The virus doesn’t work this way. You get it whether you’re a liberal or a conservative.” Dror Walter, a professor at Georgia State, and Kathleen Jameson Hall, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at Penn, coauthored the study. Hall’s 2018 book, Cyber War, looks at how Russian hackers and trolls helped elect Trump. The main finding and concern of the latest research, Ophir said, is that such Russian influence could have a detrimental effect on public health. “If the Russians are harnessing this new phenomenon and sending people different messages, you’re going to see widening gaps between the number of conservatives willing to get vaccinated and liberals,"" he said. The Annenberg study was also notable for its look at how detailed the Russian agency was in developing believable Twitter characters. The study analyzed about three million tweets sent over three years, paying special attention to nine distinct “personas.” The anti-Trump persona shared information supporting vaccines and often included links to reputable news organizations’ articles. The pro-Trump persona often shared conservative website links, photos of MAGA merchandise, and anti-vaccination views. There were also accounts that made no mention of vaccines, like fake youth accounts where topics were heavy with references to celebrities including the Russia-born Maria Sharapova and Alexander Nevsky, an 13th-century Russian leader. The Russians also created personas imitating African American users who posted about Black Lives Matter activism and celebrities like Talib Kweli. These accounts often used the N-word. Views on vaccines were more mixed with about half of the fake African American accounts favoring vaccination and half opposing it. The study found that “the intentional Russian spread of antivaccine discourse targeted at specific subpopulations thought to be susceptible to it (e.g., pro-Trump users and African Americans on Twitter) could be the beginning of a new front in the ongoing informational cyberwar.” The Russian troll accounts identified in the research have all since been blocked by Twitter, but U.S. intelligence sees evidence the country is trying to influence the 2020 election. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign said federal officials warned it that Russia was trying to help him become the Democratic nominee, as it was found to have done in 2016. Polling shows a stark partisan divide in view of how Trump is handling the crisis but not much difference in behavior. While 91% of Republicans said Trump’s handling of the crisis was “very good” or “somewhat good” in a CBS News poll last week, just 22% of Democrats said so. Democrats were much more likely to call the coronavirus a crisis (71%) than Republicans (51%). Notably, though, 61% of Democrats and 56% of Republicans answered that they were only leaving the house if “absolutely necessary.” Ninety-six percent of Democrats and 87% of Republicans said they were practicing social distancing. Trump on Sunday changed his tone on the coronavirus, underlining its seriousness by backing away from a plan to lift restrictions in time for Easter. Ophir says he fears mixed messaging suggests to the public that everything is a subjective opinion, not a fact, and that people will align with their political tribe or team instead of with science. “A lot of people — especially conservatives in the United States — heard, ‘Oh it’s nothing, it’s a liberal plot,’ and then suddenly they’re hearing, ‘It is something and yes, it is much bigger than the flu,’ "" he said. “This inconsistency can increase uncertainty and lead to confusion.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,D573QRVLCVDP5HOFS2JS56RLJ4
190,"DoNotPub - Hospitalized with coronavirus, I fought for my life and watched the death toll rise","Last week, while lying in a hospital bed, struggling to breathe, I read about myself on the internet. “Anesthesiologist, Teacher Among New Confirmed Covid-19 Cases in PA,” the headline read. But the true headline is this: I’m one of the lucky ones. Although I tested positive for COVID-19, developed pneumonia and dangerously high liver enzyme levels, I narrowly escaped being transferred to the ICU to be put on a ventilator. I’m home now, but I wake up each night around 2 a.m., reeling from the ordeal, still battling the emotional scars of the experience. My symptoms emerged on Friday, March 13, the day after the high school where I teach English shut down under Gov. Tom Wolf’s orders. My daughter Julia accompanied me on a walk with our puppy. Halfway through, I felt overcome by weakness and complained to Julia that I didn’t know if I could make it back to our Wyncote home. She offered to go ahead and get the car, but, as a former runner, that hurt my pride, so I pushed through and made it home. That afternoon, the fevers started — with a cough, chills, aches, and pains. A former journalist, I had been following the science of the coronavirus for weeks and was convinced I had it. On Saturday morning, I called my doctor’s weekend service but was told by the covering doctor that he couldn’t order a test based on my symptoms alone. My fever never exceeded 100. I could breathe OK. I toughed out a weekend of fever, chills, and cough. I called my doctor on Monday. I was told again I couldn’t get tested based on my symptoms, but I also couldn’t be seen in the office just in case I had coronavirus. My fevers continued through Tuesday. Luckily, my doctor called back later on Tuesday — regulations had changed overnight, he said, and he could now order a test for me because of my age — 52 — and my history of asthma.  On Wednesday morning, I visited the local drive-through testing site, a dystopian experience where the doctor dressed in full hazmat gear swabbed my nostrils and suggested I start steroids after listening to my lungs. He looked me in the eye and told me not to be afraid. My test results, he said, would take four days to process. Get on the prednisone, he urged. I did, but by Thursday my breathing became labored and only worsened by the weekend. I developed nausea, lost my taste and smell. That’s the most notable hallmark of my coronavirus story — the symptoms kept morphing. Meanwhile, as I watched the nightly news, I saw the stories streaming in about more people being hospitalized and dying. I began to fear the worst, while Julia started delicately suggesting that we might need to go to the emergency room. I could see the fear on her face. I was starting to panic, but I fought my family’s pleas. I wanted to avoid the hospital at all costs. On Saturday morning, a week into my illness, I called my doctor’s weekend service again. I was barely able to speak and breathe. He insisted I go straight to my local ER. My husband, Scott, drove me there and kissed me goodbye in the parking lot. He’d never be let in, I insisted, because I surely had given him and both of my daughters the coronavirus (not to mention my colleague and his father, who in the days since my diagnosis has tested positive and has been hospitalized twice with symptoms). As soon as I was triaged, I was quarantined. That’s when my true ordeal started. After being isolated in a room on a cot with the door closed, health-care workers started poking and prodding me as they ran various tests. Nurses took my blood pressure and completed blood work. Techs ran an EKG. The respiratory therapist gave me a nebulizer treatment of albuterol for my breathing. A team took an X-ray of my chest. Another COVID test was ordered. An IV line was put in. The ER doc questioned me, and I told him I was scared, that I couldn’t breathe. All the health-care workers who cared for me were diligently trying to administer good care. But it was clear that this virus was uncharted territory. I waited in that ER room alone on a cot in a scant gown, hooked up to all sorts of wires, for about 10 hours before being moved to an official hospital room. I had no food or water. I had to study the tubes and wires so I could remember how to plug them back in when I went to the bathroom. I asked for a pillow, but there were none. No TV, the door closed at all times, I was left to labor to breathe and wait and worry. When the ER doc returned with my test results and decided he’d be admitting me, I knew it wasn’t a good sign. I’d resisted the idea of the virus winning its war against my body, but, as I stared at the walls, alone, hour after hour, my new reality set in. All those years of running, never smoking, a meat-free diet, daily vitamins. I shouldn’t be gasping for breath, I told myself. I thought about my girls and all we’d been through together. I got angry that my body was failing me. Between Saturday and Sunday, I was finally transferred to the cardiac unit, where I got more tests. My liver function levels were exponentially high. The X-ray showed pneumonia in my left lung. My COVID test came back positive at 4 a.m. Because I’m a teacher and have come in contact with many students, I emailed my principal so that families could take precautions. By Sunday the pulmonologist and infectious-diseases doctors explained that they were watching me closely and thinking about moving me to the ICU, where I might be put on a ventilator. As someone with asthma, one of my greatest fears is not being able to breathe on my own. I knew the odds of coming off the vent were not good. I’d held my father’s hand and watched him die after days on a ventilator. At that point, I became terrified. I wanted to rip the IV from my arm and flee the hospital. My family went into overdrive — and this is where I’m luckiest. When talk of the ICU and ventilator started, my sisters desperately tried to transfer me to the Hospital at the University of Pennsylvania, which has a coronavirus team. However, the two hospitals refused because they said my care plan wouldn’t change with the move. My husband remained calm and FaceTimed me by the hour, calming me when I was the most frightened and in pain. My daughters, brother-in-law, and niece delivered toiletries, food, an iPad, and other necessities to the hospital. My younger daughter, Caitlin, baked my favorite cake. Even though I knew all the medical professionals were doing their best in challenging circumstances, I still felt alone in my battle against my body. It was as if I were existing in a fish bowl: I could see doctors, nurses, and other staff discussing my case outside my window. We communicated by a phone next to my bed. I felt like a caged animal, a pariah, having to talk through a mask to the doctors and nurses who entered my room in protective gear. It was an apocalyptic experience. CNN was streaming into my room 24/7 and I watched the death numbers rise every day. Don’t let that be me, I thought to myself. The most frightening part of the experience was that it felt as if every doctor who saw me contradicted the former, seemingly spitballing on my treatment plan. I was put on steroids, then taken off steroids and told why the CDC warns against them in cases of the coronavirus. I was given a nebulizer breathing treatment (which did really help me breathe better the first day), told I could have another, and then refused any others for the remainder of my stay (even when I asked repeatedly for one) — again, I was told, because they’re not recommended in COVID cases. The first ER doctor said he and the X-ray doctor disagreed about my scan results. My family debated with the team of doctors about whether to put me on the hydroxychloroquine. Whether it was the hydroxychloroquine or not, one day after being given the drug combination (antibiotics were added), I made some progress and began breathing better. The liver function tests started trending back down. I narrowly escaped the ventilator. On Wednesday night, I was released from the hospital to continue to heal at home. After five days without a shower and my body bruised all over, one of the first things I wanted to do was to take a bath. I may be able to scrub off the gluelike sticky substance all over my chest from the repeated EKGs I was given, but it will take time for me to recover from this experience as I watch the numbers of coronavirus cases exponentially grow. I worry whether other victims of this insidious disease around the world enjoy the same access to luck, love, support, and medical care that I did. As I submerged myself in the tub, trying to scrub away thoughts of the experience, the black-and-blues on my hands, arms, and stomach from needles and IVs remain as reminders of how important access to good public health care for all is — and how fragile we all are at this moment in time.

191,Coronavirus debate: Could blood pressure meds make COVID-19 less — or more — deadly?,"As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, medical experts are debating whether blood pressure-lowering drugs that are taken by many millions of people worldwide might make COVID-19 more deadly — or less so. Several professional medical organizations have said no evidence exists to justify changing guidelines for prescribing the drugs, called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). The medications are mainstays of treating hypertension, heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Now, two separate reviews of existing studies — one published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the other in Mayo Clinic Proceedings — speculate that the drugs may be helpful for coronavirus patients. The Mayo review is by physicians battling the pandemic in Italy, Spain, and the U.S. In an accompanying video, coauthor Carl J. Lavie, a cardiologist at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans, explained that a hormone involved in high blood pressure narrows blood vessels while increasing inflammation and tissue scarring. ARBs and ACEIs tamp down production of the hormone. That “could actually be very beneficial for preventing lung injury and also for systemic health,” Lavie said. “Certainly, it is premature right now to start using these agents as a preventive measure for COVID-19 in patients. However, this is an active area for investigation.” ACEIs and ARBs act on a complex system that regulates blood pressure, fluid, and mineral balance. The problem — in theory — is that the drugs increase the activity of a protective enzyme that also appears to help the coronavirus gain entry to cells in the lungs and other organs. The concern is that the drugs could make patients more susceptible to the virus, or worsen the severity of infection. A number of studies in China, where the novel virus emerged in December, have linked high blood pressure to a higher risk of respiratory failure and death in coronavirus patients. Also, hypertension was the most common chronic health problem among COVID-19 patients. But the studies could not answer the chicken-and-egg question: Did these coronavirus patients, who tended to be older, fare worse because of their high blood pressure or other chronic illnesses, or because of drugs they were taking to treat chronic illnesses — or both? In the New England Journal article, Harvard Medical School cardiologist Muthiah Vaduganathan and his coauthors point out that after the coronavirus gets into cells using the enzyme, the germ appears to suppress the enzyme, thus reducing its protective effects in organs. That suggests ARBs and ACEIs, which boost the enzyme, may be beneficial. To test that idea, a clinical trial of losartan, an ARB, is now underway in Minnesota in hospitalized coronavirus patients who have not previously been treated with the blood pressure drugs. The Mayo article concludes that one thing is clear: Patients should not stop taking ARBs and ACEIs because these drugs reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease and kidney disease.

192,Voting by mail is a safe option during coronavirus. Here’s what you need to know about absentee ballots in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.,"As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. Voting by mail is likely the safest way to cast a ballot during the coronavirus pandemic, allowing you to avoid polling places where you face contact with other people and touch voting machines, pens, or other materials shared with other voters and poll workers. Elections officials have plans to disinfect machines and other objects, as well as to provide sinks for hand-washing or hand sanitizer, but for voters, absentee ballots require none of that. Even in the best of times, some advocates and officials say more voters should use absentee ballots, which let them take time with their selections, as well as the flexibility to choose when to vote. Now, even more people are urging their use, as it reduces the risk of coronavirus transmission. But most voters in Pennsylvania have never done it, since a new state law for the first time allows any voter to use an absentee ballot without giving a reason. (New Jersey has had a “no-excuse” system for a while.) Here’s what you need to know about voting by mail in either state. Absentee ballots, also known as mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, are a form of voting in which a paper ballot is sent to you by mail; you then fill it out and return it. They were originally intended to allow voters who could not go to polling places on election day to cast a vote, but there’s been a movement to allow anyone to vote by mail as a way to expand access to the ballot box. Any registered voter in Pennsylvania or New Jersey can vote absentee. In Pennsylvania, you can request an absentee ballot online here if you have a PennDot driver’s license or ID number. Otherwise, you’ll need to fill out a paper application — also available on that page — and mail or hand-deliver it to your county elections office, which is still open. Elections officials tend to prefer online applications, as they are easier, faster, and less prone to data-entry mistake during processing. In New Jersey, there is no way to request a ballot online. Instead, fill and print out the application here, then mail or hand-deliver it to your county clerk’s office. There is one exception this year in New Jersey: Local elections in March and April were postponed until May 12, to coincide with nonpartisan municipal elections, and those will be held entirely by mail. If you live in a town with an election that day, you will receive a mail-in ballot in advance, without needing to request one, and no polling places will be open. You would still need to apply for an absentee ballot for New Jersey’s June 2 primary, which in addition to the presidential race includes a U.S. Senate seat, U.S. House seats, and special elections for state legislative seats. Pennsylvania voters have until 5 p.m. the Tuesday before an election to request an absentee ballot — May 26, in this case. You have until 8 p.m. election day to return a completed ballot. Note: A ballot or application must be received by county elections officials before the deadline; postmarks don’t count. Make sure to leave enough time for your ballot to be delivered. In New Jersey, the county clerk’s office needs to get your application at least seven days before an election if you want to get a ballot by mail. You can also apply in person until 3 p.m. the day before the election. Ballots, which come pre-stamped in New Jersey (but not Pennsylvania), must be postmarked no later than election day and received by the county no more than 48 hours after polls close. Ballots are sent out within 50 days before an election in Pennsylvania, which for the primary election means sometime after April 13. In New Jersey, ballots are mailed beginning 45 days before the election. Many counties will wait days or even weeks before sending the ballots out, though, because court challenges mean the ballot is often not finalized at that point. Pennsylvania’s primary election was originally scheduled for April 28, before being moved to June 2. Some counties, after finalizing their ballots, began sending ballots out to voters. You can still use those ballots. The state law postponing the election explicitly allows ballots for the April 28 to be used for the postponed date. Instead of returning your ballot by mail, you can hand-deliver your absentee ballot to your county elections office until polls close on election day. This is a little bit murky right now in Pennsylvania, and county officials are trying to figure this out. Some say you should send them a written request, others say you should probably send in a new absentee ballot request with the new information. Montgomery County has a form specifically for changing or canceling absentee ballot requests. Contact your county elections office to find out how it prefers to handle this request. New Jersey state officials said the same thing: Contact your county. Yep! In Pennsylvania, you’ll be allowed to vote using a provisional ballot if you show up to a polling place. That allows elections officials to make sure you don’t vote twice, since absentee ballots can be turned in on Election Day. (Provisional ballots are separated from other votes on election day and are counted only after ensuring they are legitimate.) If elections officials confirm that you did not submit an absentee ballot, your provisional ballot will be counted. If you did submit an absentee ballot, your provisional ballot will be thrown out. Starting in November, you will be allowed to bring the absentee ballot to the polling place and hand it over to be voided, then vote normally, no provisional ballot needed. We’ve mostly been using the term absentee ballot, but Pennsylvania law technically has two different types of mail ballot: “absentee” and “mail-in” ballots. The two are functionally identical for voters, with the same deadlines and procedures. If you are unable to go to a polling place, under very specific circumstances, you probably qualify for an absentee ballot and are supposed to use that. Everyone else is supposed to use a mail-in ballot. (It’s a quirk in the law because absentee ballots are part of the state constitution. Instead of going through the lengthy process of amending the state constitution, lawmakers in Harrisburg expanded absentee ballot access by creating a new category, “mail-in” ballot, which they made identical to absentee ballots.) And don’t worry — if you get mixed up, no one can challenge your vote on the basis of your using the wrong type of ballot. Yes. They are counted and part of the official results. That said, some counties, such as Philadelphia, don’t always count and report them as part of their unofficial tallies on election night. That can be confusing because results may appear final even though they are missing the absentee ballots. (That’s one reason results can shift after election night.) Of course, not every absentee ballot is counted. Some are rejected for technical reasons, such as a lack of signature. If you are in the military, or live overseas, (known as UOCAVA or UMOVA voters for the federal laws applying to them), you have a different ballot and application process, with later deadlines. Find out more, and request a federal absentee ballot online, from the Federal Voting Assistance Program. In Pennsylvania, not exactly. You can sign up to keep receiving absentee ballot applications that you must fill out once a year. You will continue receiving applications every year to help ease the process. In New Jersey, yes. You can sign up to be on a permanent absentee ballot list and be mailed an absentee ballot for every election. Because the virus is transmitted primarily through person-to-person contact and respiratory droplets, mail is thought to present a very low risk. You can lower that risk even further by not picking mail up directly from a carrier and by washing your hands.

193,"The coronavirus surge is coming: Racing for supplies, Pa. hopes to avoid disaster and New Jersey fears it’s here","As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. In the three weeks since Pennsylvania’s first social distancing measures took effect, all schools and most businesses have closed indefinitely, the state’s nearly 13 million residents have been ordered to stay home, and more than 10,000  people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Gov. Tom Wolf has said officials are trying to keep the state’s hospital system from “collapsing,” and doctors and nurses tell of mask shortages while members of the military line up cots in empty schools. Some projections say the state can still avoid the disaster unfolding in neighboring states. There is a chance — if residents stay home — that “we actually nip this in the bud,” Wolf said Friday. New Jersey has confirmed more than 34,000  infections and over 840  deaths. Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday that the state may be only a week behind the nation’s coronavirus epicenter, New York, where more than 3,000 have died. Four weeks into the region’s crisis, government data and interviews indicate that Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and some cities and towns within them have increased their equipment stockpile and taken precautionary steps recommended by experts — but remain short of the medical equipment they need. And with the pandemic’s likely peak weeks away, the worst is yet to come. With no treatment and no vaccine — and just days to prepare — governmental and health officials are trying to amass the things they believe will give them a shot at slowing the coronavirus’ grim toll: hospital beds to treat patients, ventilators to keep them breathing, and masks and supplies to protect the workers on the front lines. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided only a fraction of the supplies requested by states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, data and records released by the House of Representatives show. And efforts by domestic manufacturers to produce more are “not moving fast enough,” FEMA told lawmakers. Pennsylvania faces “drastic life-threatening circumstances” if it doesn’t get more ventilators, state officials warned in one request for equipment in late March. New Jersey says it could run out of room in its intensive care units in less than two weeks. If 20% of the population catches the virus, both states’ hospital-bed capacity will be overwhelmed in six months, one study said. “It’s unreal. It’s like nothing we have ever seen before,” said Alice Barden, a nurse at Englewood Hospital in Bergen County, New Jersey’s hardest-hit region. “As a country, as a system, we were not prepared for this.” Pennsylvania needs a “significant number” more hospital beds than the 37,000 it has, said Department of Health spokesperson Nate Wardle. Officials are working with the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania on a plan to increase capacity, which could include using ambulatory surgical facilities as hospitals and housing non-coronavirus patients in hotels. The state has already allowed hospitals to add beds without needing the usual approval, and hospitals have begun adding beds to unused spaces. Philadelphia hospitals, like others in the region, also freed space among their 6,200 hospital beds by canceling elective procedures. In late March, the Army Corps of Engineers began outfitting Temple University’s Liacouras Center as a makeshift medical site. “If we do all of those steps, we think it’s unlikely we’ll need more than that, but we’re going to watch this closely,” said the city’s health commissioner, Thomas Farley. Hospitals in the city and outside it have been reassigning staff, allocating equipment, and lining up volunteers. » HELP US REPORT: Are you a health care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker or other expert? We want to hear from you. Doylestown Hospital, said chief medical officer Scott Levy, is prepared to handle anything “other than the most extreme surge.” He estimated staff could stretch the hospital’s capacity by an additional 30% to 35%. “The [work] we’ve done … even in advance … of what happened in Washington state has given us the confidence that we can handle most increases other than the most extreme surge,” Levy said. New Jersey is more desperate. With about 20,000 beds total statewide, its 2,000 ICU beds could be filled by April 11 and hospitals could run out of space completely by May 8, Murphy’s administration has said. But 2,300 beds should be added to the state’s capacity in the coming weeks as health officials reopen at least two hospitals and multiple hospital wings that were previously closed. Four temporary hospitals — together providing up to 1,000 beds — are also on their way from the Army Corps of Engineers; the first one, in Secaucus, will be operational in days. Just as critical as finding spots for the infected is preventing doctors, medical personnel, and first responders from joining their ranks. Specialized masks, gloves, gowns, and other equipment enable responders to care for patients without contracting the highly contagious virus. No Pennsylvania hospital has been overwhelmed yet, health officials say, and the state still has some stores of unused equipment. But officials are “scouring” the state and country for materials to purchase, and workers at hospitals across the region have sounded alarms since the start of the crisis of having to reuse masks, go without testing kits, or search desperately for supplies. It remains unclear how many beds and masks are still needed statewide or exactly where, because health officials do not have “granular” data by region, state Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Tuesday. The state Health Department could not even estimate whether it had received thousands or hundreds of thousands of masks from the federal government because the shipments weren’t labeled, its spokesperson said. Philadelphia had to throw out nearly 10,000 masks in a federal shipment because they arrived ruined by dry rot. » ASK US: Do you have a question about the coronavirus and how it affects your health, work and life? Ask our reporters. As of Thursday, Pennsylvania had received less than a quarter of the N95 masks it requested from FEMA and its requests for coveralls, gloves, and gowns had also been only partially fulfilled, according to agency documents released by the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee. More N95 masks are on the way, but the amount will still leave the state with 260,000 fewer than it requested. By contrast, FEMA sent tens of thousands more face shields and surgical masks than Pennsylvania requested. The FEMA records show similar shortfalls for other states in the region, and “confirm the urgent warnings we have been hearing from the nation’s governors and health care professionals for weeks — they do not have enough personal protective equipment and medical supplies, and the [Trump] Administration has provided only a tiny fraction of what they desperately need,” Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D., N.Y.) said in a statement Thursday. Pennsylvania has already distributed close to 900,000 masks to health-care workers and frontline responders, Wardle said, though he didn’t have data for how well-supplied individual hospitals or counties are. But even they are reusing masks and relying on donations. Nurses in Philadelphia say they don’t have enough testing kits. Others at the 11 Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals hospitals in the region don’t have enough personal protective equipment. Because the amount of PPE supplies varies by facility and changes rapidly, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania can’t estimate just how serious the current shortage might be, spokesperson Rachel Moore said. Its emergency management staff are tracking supply levels across the state and anticipate shortages “in part due to high demand and lags in the supply chain,” she said in an email. There is “a direct link between everyone staying home and our health-care system’s ability to handle a surge,” she said. Philadelphia anticipates needing from 10,000 to 30,000 masks per day for health-care workers and emergency responders, Mayor Jim Kenney’s administration has told City Council. City officials hope more will arrive from the federal stockpile. The city also has tried to get supplies on its own, agreeing to spend $2.8 million for an order of 500,000 masks. But the shipment “never got out of Europe” and the order was canceled, City Managing Director Brian Abernathy said Friday. “It is unfortunate that municipalities are being forced to try and find this PPE on [their] own,” he said. “We don’t have enough resources.” City officials are also concerned about the number of ventilators that might be needed, Farley said, and believe there are not enough virus tests available. In New Jersey, Murphy took the dramatic step of using state dollars to order 10 million personal protective items from private suppliers, saying Monday there was “no price too high to save a life.” Still, the state has only about half the protective equipment it needs. And ventilators — which are essential in keeping critically ill patients alive — remain a major concern nationwide. Murphy tweeted this past week that “ventilators are our #1 need right now.” Pennsylvania needs at least 1,400 more ventilators. The state procured 400, which are on their way, and requested 1,000 from the Strategic National Stockpile but has not been told when or if it will get them. There are about 4,000 statewide, plus a few hundred in the Department of Health’s storage, Wardle said. New Jersey has 2,500; it has received a few hundred from the federal government but is waiting for more. An analysis by public health experts at Harvard University suggests both states’ stockpiles aren’t enough as the peak approaches: Pennsylvania may need at least 6,000 at the virus’ peak; New Jersey will likely require more than 4,000. “The hope is you’d get to a point where this is just over-preparation or over-training and we don’t have to reach a point where we truly need to ration scarce resources,” said Thomas Tsai, one of the Harvard researchers. “The hope is that the supply of ventilator production will catch up. But we can’t count on that.” Predicting when the virus will peak is “not simple,” said Levine, the state health secretary. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh hope to soon have a projection, she said, but modeling the virus is like predicting the weather. “If the wind changes direction or the temperature changes even a few degrees, it can make a difference between two feet of snow or some light flurries,” she said. Similarly, Philadelphia’s health commissioner said varying models show different peaks for the city. He said it is still possible that the city could avoid its hospitals being overrun and short of medical equipment. “We certainly want to flatten the curve [of rising infections] as much as we can, and it’s absolutely still possible that we can do that to the point where every resource is available to everyone,” Farley said. Displaying his first cautious optimism in weeks, Wolf said his stay-at-home order, which he expanded to the entire state Wednesday, has already “done good things” to slow the virus’ spread. Some models, he said, show the state will be overwhelmed, but others suggest a much higher death toll can be avoided if people continue social distancing. “This is no time to relax,” Montgomery County Commissioners Chair Val Arkoosh, a physician, said on Tuesday. “This is a time to hunker down [and] redouble your efforts.” Even amid some hopeful points in recent days, leaders in recent days cautioned that restrictions must stay in place at least until April 30 to continue giving Pennsylvania a fighting chance. ""This is what we do know,” said Levine. “If we do not all stay home, then we will see the worst-case scenarios.” Staff writers Vinny Vella, Mike Newall, and Jonathan Tamari contributed to this article.

194,Hahnemann owner’s home vandalized after city balks at $1M offer to use hospital for coronavirus patients,"A Center City home belonging to the owner of the former Hahnemann University Hospital property was defaced just days after he and the city failed to come to an agreement on leasing the closed medical facility amid the coronavirus outbreak, and Mayor Jim Kenney said the California businessman was “trying to make a buck” off the pandemic. On Monday, passersby noticed spray-painted letters spelling out “Joel Kills"" and “Free Hahnemann” on Joel Freedman’s property on the 2100 block of Locust Street. Fliers fastened on a door appeared to read “Joel Freedman has blood on his hands” and “Open Hahnemann Hospital.” Philadelphia police said they responded to the block for reports of vandalism but could not provide any other information. Freedman, through a spokesperson, called the vandalism “sad and uncalled for” and reiterated that his offer to lease the 500-bed hospital for nearly $1 million a month was fair. “Vandalism or hate is never acceptable, nor will it solve any problems, rather it is a time to come together and work collectively for the best of the community,"" said spokesperson Sam Singer. ""That is what Mr. Freedman attempted to do, and the city determined the site was not suitable for its needs.” Officials are trying to rapidly expand the city’s hospital capacity in preparation for a surge of coronavirus patients. During recent negotiations, Freedman offered to rent the former Hahnemann building, which has sat empty since the hospital closed last summer, to the city for about $910,000 a month in rent and fees. Singer said last week the offer was “a hugely, deeply, discounted rate compared to other known comparable situations.” But Kenney said the price was far too high. Managing Director Brian Abernathy said Freedman was “looking at this as a business transaction rather than providing an imminent and important need to the city and our residents.” The dispute received national attention as cities throughout the country look for hospital overflow space and the coronavirus threatens to overwhelm the American health-care system. On Monday, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders weighed in on Twitter, echoing Philadelphia Councilmember Helen Gym’s call for the city to use eminent domain to reopen Hahnemann. In July, Sanders rallied against the hospital’s closure and for his Medicare for All platform outside the North Broad Street building. “We are facing estimates of over 100,000 coronavirus deaths,” Sanders tweeted Monday. “It is outrageous that a Philadelphia real estate investor who closed a hospital is now trying to gouge the city to reopen it.” On social media, critics of Freedman have posted negative memes and even shared the address of his Philadelphia home, which has been for sale since the fall. The 5,500-square-foot property was initially listed at nearly $3.5 million, but the price was cut to just under $3 million earlier this month, according to Zillow. Freedman also owns property in Southern California. When Hahnemann closed, it left thousands of employees out of work and sent medical residents scrambling to find new hospitals. It also left many vulnerable low-income Philadelphians without their neighborhood hospital. As the pandemic intensifies, Freedman remains open to conversations with the city or the state, Singer said, and wants to help. Kenney, however, has indicated the conversations are over. “We had to go back and forth ... with a multi-millionaire owner who wanted to maximize his profits,” Kenney said on NPR on Sunday. “So we decided, rather than continue to go back and forth with him, we moved on.” Meanwhile on Monday, Federal Emergency Management Agency officials were turning Temple University’s Liacouras Center into a 250-bed emergency hospital. Kenney said the university made the center, as well as other campus facilities, available at no cost.

195,Poconos county becomes a ‘hot zone’ for coronavirus cases,"Every morning, way before the sun rises, many Poconos residents wake up and then head 75 miles east to New York City, on what’s been called America’s worst commute. Then they come back home. As the coronavirus pandemic spreads throughout the country, the Poconos’ long-standing connection to New York and its place as a vacation destination for people from all over the Northeast is causing problems that locals say they can’t handle. “I would appreciate, if they are essential employees and have to work, that they find a way to stay"" in New York, said Sharon S. Laverdure, chair of the Monroe County Board of Commissioners. “Local hotels should put them up.” Monroe County is separated from New Jersey by the Delaware River, with I-80 running straight through. While it’s considered one of Pennsylvania’s 48 rural counties, based on the 2010 U.S. Census, Monroe has far more coronavirus cases than other rural counties. As of Monday afternoon, Monroe had reported 182 confirmed coronavirus cases and seven deaths. The three remaining counties that make up the Poconos region — Pike, Carbon, and Wayne — have 62 cases combined. Hospital officials in Monroe County fear the number of cases there is underreported. “Monroe County is currently a hot zone for COVID-19,” Don Seiple, president of St. Luke’s Hospital’s 90-bed Monroe Campus in Stroudsburg, said during a news conference Sunday. ""The vast majority of our emergency room patients that are presenting have COVID-19 symptoms. More than half of our inpatients that we’re caring for today are COVID-related. This is stretching the hospital’s resources to the max. "" Monroe is one of 26 Pennsylvania counties on Gov. Tom Wolf’s shelter-in-place list. Laverdure said the flow of Monroe County commuters to and from New York and New Jersey was reduced when Martz Trailways suspended its bus services from Delaware Water Gap to New York City and Philadelphia last week. Laverdure and other officials are still concerned that second-home owners will see the Poconos as a safe haven from the coronavirus and look to quarantine there instead of their primary residence. In a Facebook post Monday morning, State Sen. Mario Scavello of Monroe County asked followers to forward him any “vacation rentals, Airbnb’s or individuals encouraging people to travel from the tri-state area."" “As a former resident of New York City, I appreciate people and families traveling to Pennsylvania to vacation and enjoy all the beauty we have to offer; however, our state under the governor’s order is on lockdown,” Scavello wrote. Nearly 2,000 people had shared it by Monday afternoon, and Scavello later noted that many of the advertisements were taken down. On the Craigslist Poconos page, however, an individual who posted a building lot for sale in the East Stroudsburg area promised “in this forest location you will never get corona virus!!!” An advertisement for a home rental in Long Pond, Monroe County, noted that the county only had 34 coronavirus cases, an outdated number. “If anyone is looking for a getaway house for a month or two, this would be ideal location.” the ad suggested. While the skiing season in Pennsylvania was already winding down when the virus struck, the Poconos have transitioned into a nearly year-round tourist destination. Many of those ski resorts have mountain biking and hiking options, and indoor water parks have become popular there as well. More than 30 million people visit yearly, and many own second homes there. “If you are debating, en route, or have already decided to take up shelter in this region, local business and local government is requesting that each individual does their part so that they don’t exacerbate the virus’ spread,” the Poconos Mountains Visitors Bureau said in a statement. ""That includes following the self-quarantine for 14 days, maintaining proper social distancing, and bringing supplies with you. "" Laverdure, who took office in January, said the ski resorts are closed but noted it wouldn’t be legal to bar vacation homeowners from coming there “unless the governor steps in.” “At this point in time,"" she said, ""it’s an honor system.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,Y5MMIJ3YV5CCVBXL3O2I4TRE6A
196,"Can I get the coronavirus from mail or food delivery? The risk is tiny, and you can make it even smaller.","As millions of us stay home and limit our exposure to other people and to public places during the coronavirus pandemic, online shopping and food delivery have boomed. That raises some questions: Can I get infected from the mail? What if the person who makes the food is sick? Could a sick delivery person transfer the virus to me? Good news: The risk is small. As the virus has spread across the globe, newspapers, mail, and food delivery appear to be generally safe. Even better news: There are steps you can take to minimize that risk even further. There is currently no evidence of COVID-19 transmission from food, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration. That means food itself isn’t the concern. What small risk exists comes from the packaging being handled by, say, an infected delivery person. “In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures,” the CDC says. Theoretically, there is the chance that you touch something with the virus on it and then touch your face, infecting yourself. It’s hard to say exactly what the risk is from mail or food delivery packaging, said John Zurlo, division director of infectious diseases at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. “We don’t have any good models for that, to truly understand it,” he said. “So should you somehow try and clean and disinfect every item that you touch or comes into the house? Boy, that’s a tough one.” But he emphasized that available data point to the coronavirus being spread primarily through respiratory droplets, such as from coughing and sneezing. That’s why maintaining physical space through social distancing is so important. It’s true that this coronavirus can survive on some surfaces, including up to 24 hours on cardboard and three days on plastic and stainless steel. But levels of the virus drop quickly, and being detectable is not the same thing as being infectious. “It’s important to remind ourselves that coronavirus is spread mainly through person-to-person contact and respiratory droplets,” said Jen Caudle, a family physician and professor at Rowan University’s School of Osteopathic Medicine. Do what you can to minimize risk, but don’t overly worry about being unable to eliminate it entirely. In fact, delivery of food might be a good idea because it helps limit exposure to potential infection from going grocery shopping, said James E. Rogers, Consumer Reports’ directory of food safety research and testing and a former research microbiologist for the Army. “If you’re going to the grocery store, you don’t know who else is in there with you,” Rogers said. “We know there’s not 100% compliance of fellow shoppers doing what they should be doing to minimize not only their exposure to the virus, but their exposing us to whatever they’re carrying.” He said his family uses food delivery often. Delivery services are also offering contact-less deliveries, in which the package is dropped off without direct handoff. That further reduces exposure because there’s no in-person contact. (Just make sure to tip online, as you won’t be handing over any cash.) To kill off whatever virus might happen to be present, you can wipe down the packaging after receiving a food delivery, Caudle said. Even better, she said, is to take the food out of the packaging, put it into a different container, and then throw out the packaging. And most important is the one you’ve already heard a thousand times over, because it protects you even if you’ve actually come into contact with the virus. “Make sure you’re washing your hands,” Caudle said. “Wash your hands a lot.” Staff writer Jenn Ladd contributed to this article.

197,Coronavirus is hitting the music world hard as John Prine and others are diagnosed,"Coronavirus has already shut down the concert industry. Now the pandemic is making its impact felt more personally as musicians and other notable figures in the industry are being diagnosed with COVID-19. On Sunday, the family of John Prine shared news that the songwriting great had been hospitalized  “after a sudden onset"" of COVID-19 symptoms. Music social media immediately filled up with posts pulling for the 73-year-old singer-songwriter. Known for “Hello In There” and “Angel From Montgomery,"" Prine lives in Nashville and is a patron saint of the Americana roots music scene. His condition was initially described as critical. But his wife, Fiona, who also tested positive, posted an update on Monday that she had recovered  and that her husband was stable. “Sing his songs. Stay home and wash hands. John loves you. I love you.” For Philadelphia music fans, word of Prine‘s condition came on top of  news about Gene Shay, the beloved folk music DJ and cofounder of the Philadelphia Folk Festival. On Friday, Shay’s son-in-law Tom Vaughan posted on Facebook that Shay, who turned 85 this month, tested positive for the virus and was put on a ventilator in an intensive-care unit at Lankanau Medical Center in Wynnewood, where he lives.  The Philly folk music community sent love and prayers to the radio legend born Ivan Shaner, who first brought Bob Dylan to Philadelphia in 1963 and who late DJ Ed Sciaky once called “the father of FM rock radio in Philadelphia.” He’s best known for a Sunday night folk show format he starting hosting at WHAT-FM in 1962. He would continue it, on various Philadelphia stations, until 2015. Over the course of the weekend, Vaughan updated Shay’s friends and fans with encouraging news. On Monday, he reported that there was ”slow and steady progress towards the point where he can be removed from the ventilator. He’s not there yet, but so far, so good.” On Sunday night on WXPN-FM (88.5), Ian Zolitor, who took over as host of the Folk Show from Shay in 2015, paid tribute to his mentor, as well as to Prine and Tom Rush, the 79-year-old folkie and frequent performer at the Philly Folk Fest who announced Saturday on Twitter that he had tested positive for coronavirus. That news followed word earlier last week that 1970s songwriter Jackson Browne, who’s 71, has the coronavirus. In a Rolling Stone interview, Browne, who has said his symptoms have been mild, guessed that he might have caught the virus when he was playing a benefit concert at the Beacon Theater in New York on March 12. Former Bob Dylan guitarist Larry Campbell, who sometimes performs at Philly venues such as Ardmore Music Hall with his wife, Teresa Williams, played the same benefit as Browne and also tested positive. (The couple last performed in Philly last May.) This weekend, Williams said that his condition was improving. Last week, Houston rapper Scarface of the Geto Boys, creators of the 1991 classic “Mind Playing Tricks On Me,” announced that he had tested positive after being ill for most of March. “The whole three weeks has been an ordeal,” said the rapper, whose real name is Brad Jordan. “It’s the craziest [stuff] I have ever done and seen in my life. I been to the point where I felt I was just gonna die.” Another Houston rapper, Slim Thug, known for “Check On It,” his 2005 collaboration with Beyoncé, also announced he tested positive. “Don’t think that because you’re young you can’t get it,” the 39-year-old told a Houston TV station. ""Anybody can get it … It’s still going to have you feeling a certain way so my advice to everybody is to avoid it.” Several well-known musicians have died from complications of the virus. Manu Dibango, the Cameroonian sax player best known for his 1972 Afro-funk hit “Soul Makossa,” passed away last Tuesday. Country singer Joe Diffie, 61, whose 1990s hits included “Pickup Man” and “Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die),” succumbed to coronavirus complications Sunday.  And Alan Merrill, who cowrote and sang “I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll” with his band the Arrows before it became a career-defining hit for Joan Jett, died on Sunday. “I still remember watching the Arrows on TV in London and being blown away by the song that screamed hit to me,” Jett tweeted.

198,Gov. Tom Wolf’s former business keeps operating during coronavirus shutdown despite losing state waiver,"This story was produced as part of a joint effort among Spotlight PA, LNP Media Group, PennLive, PA Post, and WITF to cover how Pennsylvania state government is responding to the coronavirus. Sign up for Spotlight PA’s newsletter. HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf’s former business, a cabinet supply company in central Pennsylvania, has continued operating during the coronavirus shutdown despite having its waiver rescinded by state officials, PA Post and Spotlight PA have learned. Last week, in response to questions from the news organizations about how the company qualified as “life-sustaining,” the governor’s office said in a statement that a waiver that had been issued to Wolf Home Products allowing it to stay open would be revoked, forcing it to close. The statement said Wolf Home Products “was originally approved as supporting infrastructure,” but “upon further review, [the Department of Community and Economic Development] determined that the lines of business Wolf is engaging in do not meet the criteria.” But in an interview Sunday, the company’s CEO, Craig Danielson, said seeking the waiver was merely a precaution amid uncertainty surrounding the shutdown order. He said that he closed the corporate office in York, but that the company’s warehouse operations remained open. “The waiver doesn’t mean anything,” Danielson said. “We didn’t need a waiver.” He said the company — which supplies kitchen and bath cabinets, among other products — qualifies as “life-sustaining” under the governor’s order as a provider of building materials, because it warehouses goods for other stores, and because of its trucking operations. Asked about the continuing operations, Casey Smith, a spokesperson for the Department of Community and Economic Development, said, “Wolf Org/Wolf Home Products was notified via phone on Thursday that all physical location work must stop.” “All non-life-sustaining businesses in Pennsylvania should be closed if they do not have an exemption from the commonwealth,” Smith said. But Danielson disagreed, saying, “there’s evidently confusion"" and later attributing it to a “clerical, administrative error.” The question of which businesses must close and which can stay open during the statewide coronavirus shutdown has been an ongoing point of confusion and anger since March 16, when the governor first began asking “non-essential” companies to curtail operations. Then, on March 19, Wolf expanded the order to require all companies but those deemed “life-sustaining” to close their physical operations. His administration released a list of industries labeled as to whether or not they could remain open, and since then, officials have twice revised that list. The governor also created a waiver process that allows any business to apply and make an argument about why it is “life-sustaining.” The state had received more than 24,000 waiver requests as of Wednesday. Of those, 4,003 had been approved and 4,439 had been denied. But many in the business community have complained that the waivers are being applied inconsistently and decided in secret. State officials have repeatedly declined Spotlight PA’s requests to release the full list of waiver requests, including those granted or denied. Deciding which businesses can operate and which must close during the coronavirus outbreak, which could continue for weeks or months, has enormous implications for businesses, workers, and their families. A waiver could mean the difference between solvency and bankruptcy. “Imagine having the powers of Thanos to knock out all of your competition with a stroke of a pen, as the governor so effectively managed to do with little notice or outrage,” state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R., Franklin) said in a statement Friday afternoon. Mastriano is seeking co-sponsors for a bill to allow businesses to reopen if they take certain precautions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, saying that the waiver process is “flawed, ineffective, lacks accountability, has no oversight, and is riddled with unconstitutional powers.” The Wolf business dates to 1843 and an ancestor of the governor’s. The governor was part of the sixth generation to run the business. Based in York, it sells cabinetry, vanity tops, decking and porch materials, outdoor siding, and other products, according to its website. The company employs more than 350 people, and most work in Pennsylvania, Danielson said. After winning election in 2014, the governor said he put his assets in a blind trust, and he gave a cousin and former business partner authority to sell shares in the business. A private equity firm announced that it had bought a majority stake in the company in May 2015, and shortly after the sale, Danielson said the governor was no longer a shareholder. Wolf’s family members aren’t shareholders, either, and none serve on the board, Danielson said. He said, as far as he knows, no Wolf family members work for the business. Danielson said he’s had little contact with the governor in recent years. They exchanged notes after the governor’s parents died, but Danielson said he hasn’t spoken to him in about two years. The business has taken precautions, Danielson said, setting up remote call centers and reducing the number of warehouse employees working during shifts. He said they are in compliance with the state requirements and shouldn’t have to close. “All my competitors are open, so how would that be fair just because my name is Wolf?” Danielson said. “Our industry is needed.” The coronavirus shutdown order empowered law enforcement, including the State Police and local police departments, to enforce business closures. Philip Given, York’s acting director of economic and community development, said Wolf Home Products was one of many companies that city investigators determined was eligible to remain open. The city did not check to see whether the company had a waiver. Given said he believed the business qualified as life-sustaining under at least one of the governor’s categories. “A lot of those categories are pretty broad,” he said, later adding, “We did not create the list. We are simply referencing and managing the list.” 100% ESSENTIAL: Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

As the number of cases rise, so do the number of unemployment claims. Both the White House and Congress have been busy with coronavirus response. President Donald Trump pushed to end social distancing measures, particularly shut downs of businesses, by Easter Sunday but eventually listened to the consensus among public health experts and extended the guidance until April 30. Meanwhile, Congress passed and Trump signed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package after much debate. The package includes direct payments to many people, but not all.

200,The Instacart coronavirus strike is unlike any strike you’ve ever seen,"A group of Instacart shoppers from around the country said they will not accept orders for grocery delivery starting Monday until the company provides, among other things, necessary safety equipment and hazard pay for those working during the coronavirus pandemic. The strike was announced Friday. Two days later, Instacart responded: It would provide hand sanitizer to workers and make it easier for them to set a default tipping percentage. The Gig Workers Collective, the group organizing the strike, said that the company’s response fell short of its demands and that the strike is still on. And one thing is clear: In this global pandemic, essential workers have power. The question is, how much power? The Instacart strike is the latest example of essential workers agitating for stronger protections during the crisis. Sanitation workers in Pittsburgh, bus drivers in Detroit, and poultry plant workers in Georgia have all staged walkouts to protest working conditions as coronavirus spreads at an alarming rate. Workers at Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, were planning a sick-out Tuesday. The concerns of the Instacart workers, whom home-deliver groceries ordered online or through a smartphone app, mirror the concerns of grocery workers across the U.S. What sets the Instacart strike apart, though, is that these workers are independent contractors — which means they’re excluded from the labor protections afforded to employees. And, most of them aren’t members of a union, meaning they don’t have the same support systems that union members have, such as strike pay. If Instacart shoppers don’t work, they don’t get paid. They also don’t have the infrastructure of a traditional union to help organize a nationwide strike. That makes their strike all the more radical. They’re relying on the fact that Instacart is hurting for labor right now. The company announced it would hire more than 300,000 shoppers during the pandemic, more than doubling its workforce. “The last few weeks have been the busiest in Instacart’s history and our teams are working around the clock to reliably and safely serve all members of our community,” Apoorva Mehta, chief executive of the San Francisco-based company, said in a statement about the hirings. Because Gig Workers Collective is a grassroots group, as opposed to a union that collects dues and could survey its members, it’s hard to know how many Instacart shoppers are participating in the strike. An online group used to organize Instacart protests has more than 15,000 shoppers, said organizer Alyssa Longobardi. She estimated that a majority are striking. But other Instacart shoppers have said in a Facebook group that they will still work because they need the money. Longobardi, who is based in Montgomery County and has been organizing Instacart workers over the last year, said one of the group’s primary concerns is getting workers the 14 days of sick pay the company said it would pay to workers affected by the crisis — including those who tested positive for the coronavirus and those who cannot work because they are under quarantine. But Longobardi said she has yet to see one person receive the pay. Workers have to prove they received a positive test result in order to be paid, but some don’t have access to testing, Longobardi said. In Philadelphia, officials have told people not to get tested unless they have symptoms and are high-risk, such as those over 65 and those with compromised immunity. Instacart declined to comment on how many workers have gotten sick pay and what the requirements are to do so. In a statement to the website Vice, the company said: “The health and safety of our entire community — shoppers, customers, and employees — is our first priority."" “Our goal is to offer a safe and flexible earnings opportunity to shoppers, while also proactively taking the appropriate precautionary measures to operate safely,"" the company said. ""We want to underscore that we absolutely respect the rights of shoppers to provide us feedback and voice their concerns. It’s a valuable way for us to continuously make improvements to the shopper experience and we’re committed to supporting this important community during this critical time.” About 100 Amazon workers, meanwhile, walked out of an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, N.Y., on Monday, demanding the facility be shut and cleaned during a paid time off after a co-worker tested positive for the virus. Amazon said it has taken aggressive steps to safeguard its employees from the virus, including enhanced cleaning and sanitation and social distancing enforcement. At the Staten Island facility, which employs 4,500 people, Amazon implemented daily temperature screenings.  Last year, Uber and Lyft drivers, including those in Philadelphia, orchestrated a similar protest against what they described as pay cuts and unfair working conditions. Drivers from more than two dozen cities and countries participated, making it what one expert called the biggest coordinated gig economy action of its kind. Despite that, it didn’t result in major changes for most Uber and Lyft drivers, suggesting the difficulty of wielding gig worker power to influence such corporations.  — This article contains information from the Associated Press.

Track the spread here. Gov. Tom Wolf ordered today that Pennsylvania schools and nonessential businesses will be closed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic indefinitely. He also extended the stay-at-home order that’s in place in 26 counties until at least April 30, my colleague Justine McDaniel reported. Officials hope to have an alternative learning plan in place for students by the start of next week. Here is a full list of what you can and can’t do under the stay-at-home order and which businesses are allowed to remain open. “We’re going to keep our schools and businesses closed as long as we need to keep them closed to keep Pennsylvania safe,” Wolf said. “I know this isn’t easy to hear... [but] if we want to save lives we must continue to distance ourselves from each other.” The peak of the coronavirus outbreak in Pennsylvania is “a moving target,” and he hopes people staying home could give hospitals a chance to provide life-saving treatment to those who are ill. ""We know that these prolonged mitigation effects have been difficult for everyone, but it is essential that everyone follows these orders and does not go out unless they absolutely must,” Health Secretary Rachel Levine said in a statement. Temple University’s Liacouras Center has been made into a makeshift hospital site, my colleague Aubrey Whelan reports. Officials are preparing for a potential surge of coronavirus patients, and though they hope they never need to use the more than 200 beds in this arena, it’s an option. The center’s transformation happened days after the city’s negotiations to reopen the vacant Hahnemann University Hospital for quarantine space had failed. Its owner, Joel Freedman, asked the city for nearly $1 million a month to rent the building, which Mayor Jim Kenney chastised, saying Freedman was “trying to make a buck” off the crisis. Adam Thiel, the city’s fire commissioner and director of emergency operations, said it is unclear if the arena would be used for COVID-19 patients or other patients who still need hospital care, but with less-pressing issues.

Employees who work for the state health and labor departments were not impacted. With declining revenues, the mandated shutdown of many businesses. and a sharp spike in demand for public assistance, the coronavirus response has already taxed resources. Pennsylvania residents have filed about 745,000 applications for unemployment compensation benefits in the past two weeks.

203,"Philadelphia region braces for surge in coronavirus cases, preps new hospital and quarantine beds"," A sobered and mostly shutdown Philadelphia region labored on Saturday to quickly transform a basketball arena, hotel, and other venues into medical sites ahead of a feared wave of coronavirus sickness and death. New cases and fatalities were reported around Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia, Delaware, Bucks, and Montgomery Counties, while the number of infections topped 11,000 in New Jersey and an additional 32 people died as Gov. Phil Murphy pleaded with residents to stay home. “No one is getting graded on a curve for social distancing,” Murphy said. “This is a pass-fail test. This is life and death.” Pennsylvania officials said people coming into the state from hammered New York City should quarantine for 14 days. President Donald Trump, who earlier had suggested on Twitter that he was considering whether to quarantine New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, said Saturday night that instead he was going to issue a “strong travel advisory” for those states. The numbers were grim: Pennsylvania health officials announced 530 more cases of the coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 2,911 in 56 counties. The death count was at least 35, with 13 new deaths reported Saturday. New Jersey’s fatalities reached 140, Murphy said at a news conference, including 32 on Saturday. Rutgers New Jersey Medical School announced its 192 final-year students would graduate early to begin residencies and provide critical health care during the outbreak. Delaware reported three deaths on Saturday, bringing its total to five. Officials said the dead were a 77-year-old man who had been hospitalized, and two men, 74 and 76, who had not, but disclosed no additional details. Health officials there also announced that a second care facility had been struck by multiple cases, after six residents of a memory-care unit of HarborChase of Wilmington tested positive. Five are now hospitalized. Across the Philadelphia region, people longed for normality in a world turned upside down — and threatening. Health-care workers emerged as the new superheroes, saluted by Superman and his Justice League colleagues in social-media memes, and on Facebook people encouraged one another to share a positive thought amid the crisis. In Philadelphia, the Four Seasons Hotel at the top of the new Comcast Technology Center arranged its lights to shine as a hopeful Valentine’s heart. In the Center City streets below, the Rittenhouse Market, at 17th and Spruce Streets, set up a dunking station to sanitize shopping carts between uses, offering some reassurance to customers worried about touching any potentially contaminated surface. “We were talking about how best to clean the hand-baskets, and one of our ideas was to use the service sinks in the back,” general manager Phil Cantor said. “We thought, ‘Why not blow it up to handle the carts?’ ” A few blocks away at 13th and Walnut Streets, the business signs for the Holiday Inn Express were covered with tarps as workers prepared to open the building as quarantine space. About 150 rooms will be available for people who tested positive for the virus, or had contact with someone who did, but who do not require hospitalization. Rooms can go to any individuals who cannot quarantine in their own homes for reasons including homelessness or because they have an immunocompromised relative. The site already has hosted some quarantined city employees. City Managing Director Brian Abernathy said officials were working to secure as many as six hotels to provide a total of at least 800 rooms. Work also was underway to create a medical center at the shuttered Glen Mills Schools campus in Delaware County, where members of the National Guard hauled supplies into the facilities on Saturday. Setup was to begin at Temple University’s Liacouras Center for overflow hospital space that could hold up to 250 patients. Glen Mills and Temple would not house patients with COVID-19, officials said. Instead, they would take in patients from other facilities, freeing hospital beds to treat those with the highly contagious virus. “Materials and supplies will be moving into the Liacouras Center over the next few days,” said Mayor Jim Kenney. “I sincerely hope we never have to use the supplies or this space, but we will be ready if we do.”  One more death was reported in Philadelphia, and Montgomery County officials reported the fifth death there, a 61-year-old woman who lived in Norristown. “On behalf of our entire community, we extend our most heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of this individual,” said Board of Commissioners Chairperson. Valerie A. Arkoosh. Across the United States, hospitals have been fighting a disaster as the numbers are exploding and frontline doctors and nurses face shortages of everything from face masks to ventilators. Philadelphia-area hospitals are preparing for a devastating surge, while praying it never comes. The city reported 806 confirmed cases — a 24-hour jump of 169 — as of Saturday morning. Delaware County officials announced a death on Saturday, bringing that county’s total to five. The patient was a 65-year-old man from Springfield Township, officials said. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf added three more counties — Beaver, Centre, and Washington — to the state’s stay-at-home order, for 22 counties total. And more than 100 retired medical professionals have applied to reactivate their licenses to help in the pandemic, Wolf said. The state also waived restrictions on nurse practitioners, who currently must practice within a specialty, and on out-of-state doctors, as Wolf said the state needs “all the hands we can get.” Close to 12% of those who tested positive have needed to be hospitalized, said state Health Secretary Rachel Levine. Of those, 97 required treatment in an intensive-care unit and 56 of those needed a ventilator. Coronavirus cases now have been confirmed in zip codes throughout Philadelphia, according to newly released data. While the map shows some neighborhoods more affected than others, it hints at the omnipresence of the coronavirus and emphasizes the need for social distancing. “It’s here,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security “It’s all over. This is why we all need to stay home.” Starting Monday, Philadelphians can pick up boxes of free food at sites around the city, officials announced. Each household can have one box, which is expected to last up to five days. No identification or proof of income is required. The hours are 10 a.m. to noon on Monday and Thursday, and pickup places are listed on the city’s website. The program is separate from the locations that offer food for students during school closures. Meanwhile, at least 180 immigration detainees held at the York County Prison started a hunger strike to demand their release. “We are chickens in a chicken coop here – we are like sitting ducks,” said one striker, Jesus, identified by only his first name by Movement of Immigration Leaders in Pennsylvania, an activist group. Health officials have warned that detention centers, jails, and prisons could be hotbeds of COVID-19 outbreaks. The migrants held at York include asylum-seekers, who are pursuing a legal means of staying in the country. The strikers fear that the virus will be brought inside by staff, and that once detainees become ill they will not get proper medical attention, according to MILPA and immigration attorney Alyssa Kane of ALDEA – The People’s Justice Center in Reading. In New Jersey, Gov. Murphy announced that financial institutions will provide mortgage forbearance and financial protections for residents facing money trouble because of the virus. The goal is to “ensure that no one loses their home during this public health crisis,” he said. Police in Ewing Township cited a man for throwing a packed party in his Mercer County apartment, in defiance of government stay-at-home restrictions. Disorderly persons citations were issued to Wade E. Jackson, 54, for obstruction and violating an executive order after police found 47 people, including a DJ, inside the 550-square-foot apartment. Murphy said he had not spoken with Trump about a possible quarantine of the Garden State. The two spoke on Friday though “nothing on quarantine came up,” Murphy said. There’s “no question the greater New York metro area is the No. 1 hot spot in America right now,” Murphy said. “Until further notified, we’re going to keep doing exactly what we’re doing.” Staff writers Vinny Vella and Susan Snyder contributed to this article, as did Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,XAI2D4XWHRFGJCSHORJ2JQIJR4

New Jersey’s death toll reached 132, as the known number of cases in the state surpassed 11,000. 🛑President Trump is considering an enforced quarantine for the greater New York City area, including part of New Jersey. 💰New Jersey state officials reached a deal with banks to allow a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments from borrowers who have been economically hurt by the outbreak. 👐Plans are underway in Philadelphia and the region to open quarantine sites for people who have the virus, and field hospitals to handle an overflow of patients. 📈As of Saturday afternoon, there are at least 1,850 reported cases in the Philadelphia area. COVID-19 has spread to all corners of Philadelphia, according to data released by the city this week. Some city zip codes have fewer than five cases, while one has more than 40, but officials say those numbers are likely far smaller than the actual numbers of people who are infected, and that they will grow significantly as the virus continues its path through the region. The numbers do serve to highlight how little testing has been completed thus far: People in Philadelphia have received the results of 5,601 tests as of Saturday, and about 14% of those were positive. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said a difference among zip codes is not large enough to say one part of the city is worse off than others. Determining which neighborhoods are hardest-hit would require testing efforts that are more widespread than what the city is currently able to carry out. Testing sites have opened in Philadelphia and the region, but officials have urged otherwise healthy residents to stay home and self-isolate if possible, so that testing can be prioritized for healthcare workers, first responders and those with underlying health conditions or those at high risk for infection. After responding to a call about an elderly man who needed help, Patrolman John Freas of Birmingham Township, Chester County, learned the man had tested positive for COVID-19. Freas was told to self-quarantine, but he shares a house with his wife, and the couple often spend time with their grandchildren. So instead of hunkering down at home, Freas became the first resident of a “first responder refuge” that Delaware County officials created at the Glen Mills Schools campus. For eight days, Freas has lived inside a converted dorm room at the shuttered reform academy. “It comes to a point where you say, 'What do I need to do to keep my family safe?’ ” Freas told reporter Vinny Vella in an interview Saturday. 🎶When this musicians’ pension fund lost big on risky investments, a local saxophonist fired back with a lawsuit that won a $27 million settlement. 📰From the Inquirer archives: How art brightened the day for pediatric patients in New Jersey. 🌱Why your home garden needs both annuals and perennials.

205,Philadelphia’s first coronavirus map offers incomplete but troubling picture ‘all over the city’,"As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in zip codes throughout the city, according to newly released data showing the most detailed picture yet of the virus’ spread. Some Philadelphia zip codes have fewer than five cases and one has more than 40. These numbers are expected to grow significantly in the days and weeks ahead as officials, hospital workers, and the community brace for a surge in cases.  The data, the most current information as of Saturday morning, provide a window into which parts of the city have residents who most availed themselves of testing, and also highlight how thinly Philadelphia has been tested, as well as how a lack of information has hindered health officials’ efforts to track the spread of the illness. People have received 5,601 test results through Saturday. The data do not indicate cases where the same person was tested more than once, but based on the test numbers it appears less than .5% of the population has been tested for the virus. About 800 people, or 14% of those who have been tested, were found to be infected with the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases is almost certainly much lower than the actual number of infected people in Philadelphia. The relatively low proportion of positive test results could be a result of several factors, city health officials said, including fewer actual cases than other cities have experienced or a difference in the testing criteria in Philadelphia that allows people to be tested. While the map shows some neighborhoods more affected than others, it is more likely the virus has spread widely throughout the city, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The map does, though, hint at the omnipresence of the coronavirus and emphasizes the need to practice social distancing. ”It’s here,"" she said. ""It’s all over. This is why we all need to stay home.” A difference of a few dozen cases between zip codes is not large enough to say one area is worse off than others, Nuzzo observed. Accurately identifying where clusters of infection are in the city, Garrow said, would require widespread testing in a particular area, and the city lacks the test kits and lab capacity to do that. “These numbers are undercounts of what we feel the real number of cases in those zip codes are,” said James Garrow, a spokesperson for the city’s health department. The map and the data behind it, though, provide an indication of where people have been more likely to be tested. Population density and access to health care play roles in shading neighborhoods’ infection numbers, but so does wealth. The data provided by the city showed that testing rates were higher in the city’s wealthier zip codes. Center City, with 20 cases per 10,000 residents, and Center City West, with 14 cases per 10,000, had the highest rates of infected residents. Both also had among the highest rates of people who sought testing. Chinatown, which was hurt economically when the virus first spread from Wuhan, China, had the highest rate of testing in Philadelphia. Zip codes with higher rates of tested residents, Garrow said, could indicate people more in the habit of seeking medical care when they feel sick, in part due to living near large health providers. “I could say that anecdotally these are places where people tend to have better access to those large health-care systems,” Garrow said. “The one in West Philly, that’s right near Penn and CHOP.” Conversely, he said, people who live in zip codes where there were few confirmed cases should not take that as a sign that the coronavirus has passed them by. It might simply mean fewer people were tested. “Just because you live in a particular area doesn’t make you more at risk or less at risk,” Garrow said. As cases rise, Nuzzo said, people should pay attention to how the map changes. Health-care facilities could also use this kind of visualization to prepare, the best they can, for cases in the coming weeks. Hospitals know where patients typically come from. “If I were at a health facility, I would be looking at this map thinking, ‘How hard are we going to be hit?’” she said. “If they see where the cases are, they might be able to use it to anticipate.” If nothing else, the map should motivate people to adhere to the city’s stay-at-home order, Nuzzo said, something some Philadelphians continue to take lightly. An official announcing the city’s case count, she said, might not be as persuasive as seeing a map of the virus’ spread. “If you see where your house is on this map and you think, ‘Gosh there’s a whole lot of COVID-19 around me,’"" she said. “That sounds a lot more personal and real.” Cases are doubling every two to three days and city officials have expressed dismay at those not isolating themselves.  “This is all over the city,” Garrow said. “Everyone is affected by it.” Graphics editor John Duchneskie contributed to this article.

Please include your name and phone number. (Contact information will not be shared publicly.) In emergency medicine, we’re seeing things as they unfold in real time. One Saturday, I think was the 14th, I was working and noted a bunch of patients presenting with a viral syndrome with bad headaches and sore throats and some GI symptoms and other things which would not at the time have been consistent with our case definition for COVID-19. I started to be more concerned that there may be more cases in the community. I have significant experience working on the Ebola response, so from the first moment I heard about this, I was obviously hoping that the outbreak was not spreading. [Since the outbreak started in America], I’ve done a complete 180 [in my work]. I was due to be on a plane to Malawi to work on developing some of our partnerships with Jefferson there. [But because that trip was canceled], I’ve been able to help lead the emergency medicine Covid-19 Task Force. All of my attention has been diverted to this response based on having some experience working an epidemic before. I feel a bit more comfortable than most in extensive PPE [personal protective equipment] or “spacesuits.” That’s really an issue for me in terms of interactions with my family and child care and all those things which are being challenged. The concern is that for most people in the community, we don’t anticipate they’ll get critically ill, but those people may be spreading it to people who will get critically ill and that is going to be what impacts the health system and creates surges that would let us not take care of those patients in the way that we would like to if we had more capacity. Patricia C. Henwood is associate professor of emergency medicine at Thomas Jefferson University. My crews in the stations began to have concerns a few weeks ago. They were telling me: We see passengers wearing masks. Should we wear masks? Their anxiety started to rise, and their concern was, Could we get the virus? Because often they are face to face with passengers. We have always had gloves available and last month masks became available. I tell my employees, Make sure you’re sanitizing, and washing, and keeping your distance. If you’re sick, stay home for your own sake, and for the passengers coming through. How we work has changed drastically. Now we have to maintain that distance between us. Before, things were more face-to-face. Now it’s more emails and phone calls, but I still have to ease their anxiety and make sure their voices are heard. It’s more difficult now, and I feel the concern, too. I have two daughters and a granddaughter, and I don’t want to bring anything home they could catch. [PATCO] helps first responders get to their jobs, and we’ve just got to work together. It’s not easy, but we have faith that things will work out. We have to take this seriously and be careful, because it’s life and death. Sylvia Cuevas is acting director of PATCO fare collection and passenger service.  At the beginning everyone was buying in high volume, coming in frequently buying a lot of groceries. When they shut down the two schools near here — Drexel and Penn — we had a lot less customers, but … people are still buying heavily. A lot of my employees are people who work at Penn full time and have been laid off … so they were able to pick up the hours at GIANT Heirloom Market. That has been helpful and it is good that we were able to provide hours for people who can’t get the work elsewhere. We have many people applying for jobs still. We’re constantly interviewing and onboarding, even during this. At this time, you’re not going to be able to find every item that you want, but you should be able to find the staples. We are being more strategic in our [ordering] approach with making sure that the items that the customers need the most are there. It’s a risk being in a public place with so many people shopping there. I wish people knew how hard our people are working. Angel Cordero is the store manager at GIANT Heirloom Market in University City. I love taking care of people, but we nurses are scared, because we have to go home to our families. When I started hearing the news about the epidemic in China months ago, I didn’t really think it would come here. But I honestly felt like, yes, I could handle it, if it did. I work with a great group of nurses and physicians. I felt pretty confident. But I do not feel confident about the government, because of the shortage of supplies. Typically when treating a patient in this type of isolation, every mask [would be used once and then we’d] dispose of it. Now the CDC says you can use a mask for an entire shift. A shift is 12 hours. The CDC keeps changing the guidelines. I don’t know if the public realizes that. I do wish that if someone doesn’t usually come to the emergency room because they have a cough, they won’t come now — unless they have a real reason they would normally come to the emergency room. I just hope that we can flatten the curve [of rapidly increasing cases] and can get back to normal as soon as possible. People are losing their jobs, and I feel terrible. I don’t want to look at my 401(k). This isn’t just a pandemic, it’s an economic crisis, too. Shutting down everything, and the social distancing, are not easy. But this has the potential to get thousands of times worse. We have to be diligent. Angie Cleghorn is a registered nurse in the ICU at the Jeanes Campus of Temple University Hospital.  We have to take additional precautions while taking the history and getting a general impression of a patient, whether in a residence or on the street. We would normally be in closer contact, but now it’s a good 6-feet distance. It gives us peace of mind, but it hinders patient care as well, because if it’s something significant [in the history or condition of the patient] we have to retreat from the house or the street and get in our proper PPE [personal protective equipment]. And due to the increase in call volume, our supplies are kind of depleted at the moment. We have had calls [involving] coronavirus. It has been scary, but the proper PPE kind of eases your mind. People reach out to us on the phone, but people also are afraid to get in close contact with us, because we deal with the public. People are afraid we could transmit something to them. We had a couple of people who refused to get in the medic unit, as if we’re a walking coronavirus or something. I believe a lot of people aren’t taking the actual precautions of staying inside, and social distancing, seriously enough. Because of that we’re going to experience a lot of deaths. It worries me as a health-care provider, because it endangers the health and safety of all of us. Melissa Herrera is a fire service EMT at Engine 68 & Ladder 13 in Southwest Philadelphia. What kept me up last night is that I had two employees who were in the hospital because they had flulike symptoms. One had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance and another one was able to take himself to the hospital. It keeps me up at night knowing that we have all of these people who are living in our emergency housing sites, and that we’re responsible for keeping them healthy. And that we have 169 members who have family members and who have children and who have loved ones and who have no faith institutions that they’re a part of and all other kinds of things. We’re responsible for doing everything we can to make sure that they’re healthy: making sure that our team members wipe down the door, wipe down the sink, wipe down the shower, wipe down the counters. We’re literally spending all of our time just thinking, What else do we need to do to mitigate the possibility of this infection spreading in our shelter system? Because once that happens, it’s no stopping in a system where you have so many people who are sleeping in close quarters with each other. Michael Hinson, Jr. is the president and chief operating officer of SELF Incorporated, an emergency housing provider for single adults in Philadelphia. We’ve lost about 85% of our volunteer base. We still have some community members who are interested, as well as other participants of our programs, but, in general, when you’re dealing with a high-risk virus, like the coronavirus, individuals, organizations, schools that would normally send volunteers aren’t doing that anymore. They’re telling folks to stay home — and with good reason. Our drop-in center was open seven days a week, anywhere from seven to 11 hours a day. People were able to come in and get a cup of coffee and have a seat and get out of the street for the day, or for a few hours. They could get educated, or watch a movie. It was light, but it was also a gateway for folks to sign up for case management, HIV testing, medical clinics, and more. And because of social distancing policy — which we understand — we can’t have a drop-in center currently. That’s really harmful.

I go to different restaurants every day, and interact with managers and restaurant workers as well as customers. It's definitely a risk. That’s why I’m constantly washing my hands, sanitizing, and wearing protective gloves. I normally set out to hit a certain quota. Since the arrival of the coronavirus, and restaurants started taking precautions and changing store hours and things like that, there’s definitely been a decrease in the amount of money I make. Before, I would get started at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and finish by the afternoon. Now, if I come out at the same time, I’m out at least 12 hours or 16 hours to make the same amount of money. In the last few days, the tips were bigger. The customers appreciate food being delivered at a time of crisis like this. John Walker is a food delivery worker from North Philadelphia. He delivers for GrubHub, Uber Eats, Caviar, and Postmates.  We are all obsessively sanitizing our cars. ... In our minds, it makes it easier to do the job. It is obviously spreading very quickly, and that is most concerning. Of course police officers are all a little concerned about being exposed. We’re trying to do our job efficiently, but we have to take precautions. We’re not as proactive as far as traffic stops and pedestrian stops. There are some complaints we might take over the phone, as opposed to showing up… [and] if we come to your house, we might ask you to step outside. People have been pretty good [about following the guidelines], but there are still people outside. People have to live. I have noticed people are trying to maintain space. We get calls about groups congregating, and we will just drive by and say, Hey, guys, what’s going on? I’ve had contact with a lot of people who are taking it seriously, but I’ve also had contact with people who think it’s been sensationalized by the media, and kids who think, it’s just a flu — if I get it, I get it. I’m trying not to worry about it too far ahead. I don’t want to be stressed out … as it goes on. Upper Darby has a lot of small businesses, and this concerns me. Some of them may not be able to open back up. And the kids. Are they going to be able to go back to school? Amanda Shephard is a police officer in Upper Darby. We launched the West Philly [testing] site. There is also a Radnor site. It was clear we had to provide a service not only to the Penn Medicine community – our employees and our patients — but to the wider community. So many individuals do not have primary care physicians, do not have insurance. Or do not drive cars. While we wish we could have popped up sites literally everywhere, in round one for this past week, it was imperative that there was not only a drive-through but a walk-through concept as well. What’s hard is wanting to explain every piece of nuance [in this process] to our community but not being able to. Making the decision of who to test, who not to test, is something we take very seriously. We’ve engaged our infectious-disease colleagues and the leadership to make sure we’re making the best decisions for the community. But there is forever struggle when resources are constrained. On a personal level, the hardest thing is that I make my own choices. And I feel comfortable with it. It is a privilege to serve in this way. But you know…we're so grateful to the people we live with at home. That’s a burden you carry, the extra dimension to this -- it's not just yourself involved. What is your impact on the people who may have not chosen this lifestyle, but they chose you? There’s a lot of focus on physicians right now, but there are so many people who make this work. Physicians are an important part, but the amount our nurses give, and people from our registrar to the folks who actually disinfect everything to keep them clean – we need to highlight them and the decisions they have to make. Weighing for themselves, their families, and the greater good is not easy. The best you can do is the best you can do. So many people behind the scenes are putting in 20 hours a day. Kathleen Lee is director of clinical implementation for the Center for Health Care Innovation at Penn Medicine; director of innovation and an assistant professor in the department of emergency medicine.  My two-man crew and I work throughout West and Southwest Philadelphia. I take pride in what I do. My concerns have always been about health, because of the various diseases that have come along. But this disease is at the highest level. It’s got to be respected. My coworkers are being careful and naturally our concerns are pretty much the same — keeping social distance from the public, and even each other. We’re always washing our hands, and just being more mindful of what we could contract and bring to each other. We try not to dwell on the depths of how bad it is. Even before coronavirus, we worked under stress on a daily basis. You never know what’s in that bag on the curb. Now our fear is the same as anyone at the supermarket, or anyone who receives mail at their house. In all honesty the coronavirus makes me more aware on another level of how important my job is for making things safer for the public. Maybe we’ll learn to respect an outbreak when it starts, not wait until it’s in its worse stage. Next time maybe we’ll nip it in the bud and not let it grow. Zakary Wiliams has worked for the City of Philadelphia for 27 years.  Suddenly about a month ago we became very busy. People are afraid to go to a doctor’s office and be in waiting rooms, or they’re following recommendations about social distancing. So a lot of calls we’re getting now are not about coronavirus but about children with pinkeye or a rash whose parents don’t want to go to the doctor because they are fearful of being around sick people. A Teladoc pediatrician normally speaks to the parents, but when a patient is over 18 we can speak directly to them. We have a lot of college kids calling. They don’t have high levels of anxiety about [contracting] the coronavirus. But it does affect them -- they’ve been sent home from school, they’re trying to do course work online, they’re back home with their parents. They just feel that their lives have been significantly disrupted. We have never had in my lifetime anything like this. I’m not frightened from a standpoint of my own health; I am frightened for my younger loved ones and for other people in general. I am concerned about the pain and the hardships that may still be coming. Francis T. Ferry is a pediatrician in West Deptford. Three weeks ago I had a conversation with young guy who flew in from Maine, and he told me the aircraft had only 11 people on it. I said to myself, Wow, this virus is affecting everything. I have hand sanitizer in my car. In the morning before I leave [for the airport] I sanitize the doors and the seats. This is new because of the virus. And when I get home I sanitize everything before I go inside. Now the first thing when I pick up a fare is to see if they’re coughing. I say, Please, I don’t want to disrespect you, but with this virus flying all around the world, and you just came out of the aircraft and lifted your luggage ... you can sanitize your hands with my hand sanitizer. I have never denied anyone a ride, but I have to be very careful. I am a father of five and grandfather of four. I look at the person from my rear mirror and see what is going on. Normally I ask them, How was your flight? But now I say, I hope you are OK. I make sure I don’t embarrass my customers. I have to be very polite. I say, I hope you are OK, like I am. Patrick Anamah is a taxi driver.  In the last few weeks, talking to customers and other drivers, there was a slow upswing of concern. And now, we can no longer enter buildings to make deliveries. It’s a whole culture change. We are on the outside looking in. Now our customers are loading and unloading our trailers. They’re on lockdown and we are trying to make their life as easy as possible. And we have restrictions too. We have gloves on and use hand sanitizer. You go to a customer you go to every day, and usually he doesn’t have a pen on him, so you give him your pen to sign the receipt, but now, you don’t. We have to pick up [paperwork], so we have rubber gloves on. It’s a whole transformation of the transaction. Bob Dolan is a driver and sales representative, XPOLogistics in Allentown.

207,"Pennsylvania corrections officers, advocates worry a prison coronavirus outbreak is inevitable ","This story was produced as part of a joint effort among Spotlight PA, LNP Media Group, PennLive, PA Post, and WITF to cover how Pennsylvania state government is responding to the coronavirus. Sign up for Spotlight PA’s newsletter. HARRISBURG — Inmate advocacy groups and corrections officers alike are worried that a coronavirus outbreak inside Pennsylvania’s state prisons is an inevitability, and that should one occur, it could spread quickly because of the difficulty of practicing “social distancing.” Officials with the state Department of Corrections said they have taken preventative measures, such as making hand sanitizer more widely available among staff, requiring employees to wear face masks, and hiring a centralized doctor as a special adviser. As of early Friday evening, there were no reported cases of the coronavirus inside the state prison system, either among those incarcerated or corrections officers. But the union representing about 10,000 Pennsylvania corrections officers is concerned that ongoing inmate transfers and rising tensions could mean an outbreak is on the horizon. “One of the biggest issues is that we have asked the governor’s office to stop all nonessential transports of inmates, and we haven’t been successful in getting a response from that,” said Larry Blackwell, head of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association. Blackwell said inmate movement is “putting all our staff and inmates at risk.” Advocates for those incarcerated in the prisons, meanwhile, said those serving time behind bars are particularly vulnerable should the virus take hold. ""Environments of a prison are the perfect transmittal ground, and they are exactly where this virus is going to be the most pervasive and severe once it gets in,"" said Claire Shubik-Richards, executive director of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, a Philadelphia-based advocacy group. Maria Finn, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections, said each facility has a plan to isolate infected inmates, quarantine those exposed, and to do enhanced cleaning. She also said the state is clamping down on the flow of new inmates and parole violators entering the system. Beginning Saturday, officials plan to send new male inmates and parole violators to SCI Retreat in Luzerne County, while transferring most of the people currently held there to other prisons in the state, Finn said. The department is increasing medical staff and supplies at Retreat, as well. (The facility had been slated to close at the end of June and was at just over 60% capacity a month ago, according to the department.) After an “intake quarantine period,” new inmates will go to SCI Camp Hill for classification and evaluation. On average, the state receives roughly 150 new male inmates each week, Finn said. Finn said the change will “greatly [reduce] the ways the virus can enter our system.” Rob Pezzeca, who is incarcerated at SCI Forest in northwest Pennsylvania, said in an interview Friday that staff at the prison are taking precautions to prevent the introduction of the virus. He said they wear masks and have their temperatures taken before entering the facility. Inmates, too, were issued masks — although he said they were the “cheap, paper kind” — and told they can wear them when they leave their cells. “A lot of the older guys are wearing them,” Pezzeca said. With too few medical-grade masks to provide to all employees, Blackwell said the department is issuing guards and other staff cloth masks produced by inmates instead. Some members have raised concerns about the efficacy of the masks, although Blackwell said he did not have an opinion because it is too early to tell whether the protective equipment is effective. Finn said the department is following all protocols from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state Department of Health. Pezzeca said he is not aware of anyone having tested positive at SCI Forest, but he said an area has been set up so that anyone displaying symptoms can be quarantined. He also said all educational and recreational time has been canceled. Inmates are allowed outside for two 50-minute sessions in the afternoon and evening, during which they are being told to practice social distancing. He was worried the prison would be placed on lockdown because “that is when the violence starts.” He’s also worried about the lack of access to antibacterial soap, which costs about $1. “Some guys can’t afford the soap from the commissary,” he said Finn said that inmates are producing roughly 4,000 bars each week through Pennsylvania Correctional Industries and that soap is provided free of charge. Inmates, many of whom may be medically vulnerable to begin with, likely do not have access to the same level of care they would on the outside, said Shubik-Richards of the Pennsylvania Prison Society. Still, many of the measures the department has ordered — such as restricting movement within prisons — are a step in the right direction, she said, although it’s unclear to what extent all facilities are able to follow the directives. ""They're being thoughtful and they're doing what they can within the constraints that they have,"" Shubik-Richards said. ""That's not to say they can't do more. I think they can do more, and they need to do more, but they are definitely working in the right direction."" She said state and county facilities should take measures to address stress among inmates and staff, de-escalate disputes, eliminate medical copays, and release people who are not a threat to public safety. The department has suspended all visits through at least April 10. In their place, inmates have been offered 15 minutes of call time for free, as well as one 45-minute video visit per week. Shubik-Richards said those steps help reduce stress and anxiety. Blackwell said the union has reached out to the department to request extra incentives for officers who continue to work through the pandemic but has not heard back. “In a way, it’s good to be an ‘essential’ employee because you definitely aren't going to lose any pay or anything,” Blackwell said. “But as a corrections officer — a police officer, anybody — you worry about the risk of getting something and taking it back to your family.” Spotlight PA staff writer Angela Couloumbis contributed to this article. 100% ESSENTIAL: Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

208,Can I get married during the coronavirus?,"Last weekend, Stefanie Bucholski and Mike Reisman got married on a date they picked out nearly a year ago. But the celebration looked nothing like the big Jewish ceremony they had in mind. Thanks to a new worldwide wedding crasher, COVID-19, they’re among the many couples in the region who have had to change their plans. It was Saturday afternoon. Bucholski, dressed in a white gown, walked alongside her soon-to-be husband, four blocks over to her sister’s house. There, in the backyard, they joined hands to marry before a small group of three: Bucholski’s sister, brother-in-law, and a friend of her sister who happens to be an ordained minister. Everyone stood spaced out, except, of course, Bucholski and Reisman. An iPad live-streamed the ceremony through Zoom, allowing 40 friends and family members to join in, shed tears, and cheer  from afar. The crowd would gather again later in the evening for a Zoom happy hour, when Bucholski’s dad delivered a short toast. In December, the couple will host a reception to celebrate with a much larger crowd. “It was a really sweet, intimate ceremony. A little strange, but not in a bad way,” says Bucholski, 32. ""All the little squares on the [Zoom] screen was actually really cute.” If you, too, have a wedding planned in the coming weeks, we’ve put together a guide  to help navigate the situation. With a statewide stay-at-home order in place, even small gatherings  are not allowed. As such, most couples will be advised to postpone their wedding until that’s lifted. However, there are some caveats. If you need a legal marriage for health insurance, visa, or other “emergency” reasons, you may be able to move forward. Here’s what to expect as you consider your options: Courthouses are currently closed, making it impossible to apply for a marriage license in person as you’d normally do. Yet, if you had a wedding scheduled for this month, you’ve likely already tackled that step. “In PA, a marriage license is valid for 60 days, so I tell couples to apply six weeks before so they don’t have to stress out about it during their wedding week,” says local celebrant and ordained minister Alisa Tongg. If you have the license, any qualifying officiant can complete it and return it to the courthouse by mail. Once the courthouse reopens, the paperwork will be processed. “It’s official as soon as it’s signed, you just won’t get the certificate until after the courthouse opens up,” explains Tongg. If you’ve opted for a self-uniting license, Philadelphia is allowing you to send it yourself by mail to the Register of Wills (City Hall, Room 181). It must first be signed by two witnesses. The date that it’s signed will be the official date of your marriage. As with a traditional license, you will receive your marriage certificate once the Register of Wills office reopens. (Marriage laws vary state by state, and emergency modifications vary by county. Self-uniting licenses are not an option in New Jersey. In other Pennsylvania counties, self-uniting procedures may be different or temporarily not permitted. Contact your local Register of Wills office to confirm.) You cannot get married without a license. However, in Philadelphia, there are some exceptions. Starting April 6, the following individuals can apply for an “emergency marriage license”: At least one marriage license applicant must be a Philadelphia resident. You must have video-conferencing capabilities, and only self-uniting marriage licenses ($100) will be issued. Instructions for how to apply are posted to Philadelphia’s Register of Wills website, secureprod.phila.gov/wills. Here’s how it will work: You’ll need to write an email explaining your circumstances. If your request for an emergency marriage license is approved, you’ll get an application sent to you by email. Once it’s filled out, you’ll be scheduled to attend a Zoom video conference to review your situation with a clerk. From there, you’ll mail your signed, completed application and $100 payment (money order only, payable to the Clerk of Orphans Court), along with one self-addressed, stamped envelope, to the Register of Wills office, which will review your documentation. The Register of Wills office will issue a self-uniting license by mail. It’s valid for 60 days. When you get married, you’ll need signatures from two witnesses. Then you’ll mail the duplicate (bottom portion) of the self-uniting license by USPS overnight delivery with tracking with another self-addressed envelope to the Register of Wills. After the office gets your paperwork, a marriage certificate will be mailed to you. If you already have a license or qualify for an emergency marriage license, it’s time to plan your ceremony. With the stay-at-home order in place, gathering with those outside your household is not allowed. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use video to throw a party with family and friends. Your officiant, however, can’t be behind a screen. To make a marriage official, they’ll need to join you in-person, even if that means they’re standing six, 10, or 20 feet away. If you’re self-uniting, you’ll need two witnesses present. “It’s a legality of all ceremonies — to ask someone if they have come here freely to marry this other person. And if you’re in a video situation, you simply can’t see if they’re being coerced,"" says Tongg. On April 1, a statewide stay-at-home order was announced. So what does that mean if you want to get married with, say, just your partner? If your officiant or two witnesses aren’t already your roommates, it’s not advised unless your marriage qualifies as an emergency situation. In other words: If you can postpone, you should. Once your marriage is legal, you become eligible to change your health insurance or add your spouse. Those without a marriage license in hand will need to wait for the Register of Wills office to reopen to retrieve a wedding certificate. If you’ve already acquired a license pre-COVID-19, Tongg suggests getting married with an officiant and then calling your insurance company. “You won’t have your certificate yet, but you can take scans of your return — the copy of the signed license that you receive — and call the HR department of the insurance company to see if they can make an exception,” says Tongg. If it’s an emergency situation, you should apply for an emergency marriage license (see above). The answer is likely yes. With the stay-at-home orders in place, even small gatherings are discouraged — as small as just you and two witnesses. Talk with your current vendors and discuss their policies on rescheduling. “I’m sending out a spreadsheet to all my clients that shows the remaining dates I’m available this year and next,"" says local wedding photographer Lily Szabo. “They can pick one of those dates, and reschedule free of charge.” It’s a common policy among both photographers and venues. “Now’s the time to be flexible with change, whether it’s the date, the venue, the vendor, or your guest list, and to remember what matters most — starting your life with someone and the health of your family,” says Tongg.

As cases escalate locally, hospitals are bracing for a surge in patients. 🏠 Gov. Tom Wolf expanded his stay-at-home order to another nine counties: Berks, Butler, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Luzerne, Pike, Wayne, Westmoreland, and York. 🗳️ Pennsylvania’s primary election is moved to June 2, joining 11 other states and D.C. rescheduling primaries to that day because of the coronavirus. 💰President Donald Trump signed the $2.2 trillion rescue package aimed to help businesses and workers amid the economic fallout from the pandemic. Here’s what you should know about the coronavirus stimulus checks. 🇬🇧 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the first leader of a major nation to contract it. 📈 As of Friday evening, there are more than 1,600 reported cases in the Philadelphia area. Track the spread here. Philadelphia-area hospitals are preparing for the worst. Medical workers see what is happening in New York City, where a doctor at a hospital with 13 deaths in one day told the New York Times that the situation was “apocalyptic.” They predict we aren’t far behind, my colleagues Marie McCullough and Lisa Gartner report. “We anticipate we are no more than two weeks behind New York City,” said P.J. Brennan, chief medical officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System. “Cases are doubling every two to three days. ... You do the math.” By that math, Penn’s six hospitals could have at least 1,472 coronavirus patients within two weeks. And that won’t even be the peak of the crisis, which Brennan said is projected to hit in late May or June. In the meantime, hospitals are making do with scarce resources. Jefferson is working with fabric designers at its East Falls facility to make face masks and figure out how to re-sterilize used ones. Temple University will let the city use the Liacouras Center to expand hospital-bed capacity. Temple’s health system turned its 10-story building for neurosurgery and orthopedic surgery into a coronavirus hospital. There are tents set up outside of emergency departments so people with symptoms can be checked without exposing others. Hospitals are struggling to find ways to keep its workers healthy, too. Penn checks employees’ temperatures at hospital entrances. Physicians and nurses feel like they’ve been thrown into a war, said oncologist Ravi Parikh, a physician at the VA Medical Center in West Philadelphia. “But unlike traditional wars,” he and two colleagues wrote in an op-ed for The Inquirer, “these soldiers don’t sleep in trenches; they return home each night. Each trip home requires a renewed commitment to containment — to isolate their families from the disease they have spent the day fighting.” All Pennsylvania schools are closed until at least April 6, and while children in private schools and in better-resourced suburbs may be better prepared for digital learning with internet access and computers, that isn’t the case for all Philadelphia School District children. Only half of high school students and less than half of elementary school students have a computer at home, district officials said. With this disparity, and without provisions for students with special needs and English-language learners, the district has not been requiring students to learn while at home. They needed laptops. On Thursday night, the Philadelphia school board voted to allow for the purchase of 50,000 Chromebooks to make this distance learning possible during the coronavirus-related closures.

210,‘Very Temple proud’: Philly to use Liacouras Center as overflow hospital space as coronavirus cases rise,"Temple University’s Liacouras Center will become overflow hospital space if needed during the coronavirus crisis, Mayor Jim Kenney announced Friday. “Materials and supplies will be moving into the Liacouras Center over the next few days,"" Kenney said. “I sincerely hope we never have to use the supplies or this space, but we will be ready if we do.” The Liacouras Center, as well as other Temple facilities, have been made available to the city at no cost, Kenney said. “We’re very Temple proud,” he said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will bring in equipment to turn the center into a space for 250 patients, said Managing Director Brian Abernathy. He said he’s “cautiously optimistic” that additional capacity would be possible in the future. As of Friday, Philadelphia had 637 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and three deaths. Of those cases, 50 people had been hospitalized, Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said. The city expects the number of confirmed cases to grow, and is securing additional hospital space for a potential surge in hospitalizations, as has happened in other areas. Abernathy said the space would most likely be used for patients who do not have the coronavirus but are in need of other care, to free up hospital space for people with the infection. “We want to be as prepared as possible,” Abernathy said. “That is exactly why we are adding hospital beds. God willing, we won’t need them. But I certainly expect to.” The agreement with Temple includes the use of the Liacouras Center, its parking garage, and the student pavilion, an indoor athletic and practice space one block north on Broad Street, said Ray Betzner, a university spokesman. Temple owns the Liacouras Center, but it is operated by Comcast Spectacor, which also is part of the agreement. Betzner said the center would be used for hospital space and the pavilion would be used for storage. The Army Corps of Engineers will set up the facility and it will be run by military medical personnel, he said. The city also has secured a lease agreement to use The Holiday Inn Express at 13th and Walnut as quarantine and isolation space for people who cannot quarantine in their own homes. Abernathy said that site has already hosted city employees who are quarantined, and will become fully operational over the weekend. Abernathy said the city is “talking to every major institution” about potential use of their facilities. Other cities plan to use convention centers as hospital overflow space, including the Javits Center in New York and the Atlantic City Convention Center. John McNichol, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, said conversations with the city regarding the use of the space are continuing, but no decisions have been made. “Our focus is on getting back to business as soon as possible so we can save jobs,” he said. Regarding hospital-overflow use, McNichol said: “We’re trying to be as nimble as possible. Right now there’s no plan to use the Convention Center for that purpose.” City officials had wanted to use the former Hahnemann University Hospital, which closed last year, as quarantine space. But Kenney announced Thursday that the city had abandoned those negotiations after the owner wanted about $1 million per month for use of the empty building. Temple President Richard M. Englert, according to Betzner, was eager to help when approached by city and federal officials. “Temple University is part of the city and this is a fight that everyone in the city needs to enter,” Betzner said. “And Temple was happy to be a part of it.” Staff writer Anna Orso contributed to this report.

211,"Coronavirus peak is yet to come, officials warn; New Jersey death toll passes 100","Nine more Pennsylvania counties were put under Gov. Tom Wolf’s stay-at-home order on Friday, including Berks and Lancaster, bringing 19 counties in all under some form of lockdown aimed at slowing the rapid spread of the coronavirus. In New Jersey, the death toll passed 100, and Gov. Phil Murphy called on anyone with medical training to help the state’s health-care workers. As Friday marked three weeks since Pennsylvania’s first positive coronavirus test was reported, layoffs rippled through the region, Philadelphia-area hospitals were bracing for the anticipated — and potentially disastrous — patient surge, and a Pennsylvania member of Congress, Rep. Mike Kelly of Butler County, said he had tested positive for the virus. President Donald Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package intended to help businesses and workers cope with the epidemic and, after days of calls from states for the federal government to provide more equipment, ordered General Motors Co. to make ventilators. The U.S. coronavirus case count passed 100,000, the most of any country. New Jersey confirmed an additional 1,982 coronavirus cases, bringing the state total to 8,825, Murphy announced Friday. A total of 108 people have died, 27 of them since Thursday. Pennsylvania reported 531 new cases for a total of 2,218 in 50 counties. Twenty-two people have died. Montgomery County reported its fourth death, and Philadelphia and Delaware County each reported two deaths on Friday. Philadelphia also said a prison inmate and the first employee in the city’s Department of Corrections had tested positive and said five inmates were in quarantine; officials declined to provide specifics about their locations. Health officials in New Jersey, which has the second-highest number of cases in the country, warned that the peak of the outbreak is still weeks away, and Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said officials do not know when the surge is going to be, though they are watching various models. The commonwealth is “no more than two weeks” behind New York City, said P.J. Brennan, chief medical officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, on Thursday. While a peak is inevitable, “the degree of that surge will depend on the effectiveness of our prevention,” Levine said, reminding residents to continue staying home. It will take weeks for the states to know whether enough people are following social distancing and stay-at-home orders to slow the growth of coronavirus cases, but Bucks County officials said they should know in a matter of days whether social distancing measures are working there. In Philadelphia, where 637 cases have been confirmed and 50 patients have been hospitalized, officials were “talking to every major institution” in the city about the potential use of their facilities for hospital or quarantine space, Managing Director Brian Abernathy said Friday. Temple University’s Liacouras Center will become overflow hospital space, Mayor Jim Kenney announced Friday, able to hold 250 patients. “Materials and supplies will be moving into the Liacouras Center over the next few days,"" Kenney said. “I sincerely hope we never have to use the supplies or this space, but we will be ready if we do.” The arrangement includes the Liacouras Center; its parking garage; and the student pavilion, an indoor athletic and practice space one block north on Broad Street, Temple spokesperson Ray Betzner said. The center would be used for the hospital and the pavilion for storage. It will most likely be used for patients who do not have the coronavirus but are in need of other care, to free up hospital space for people with the infection, Abernathy said. The university facilities were provided to the city at no cost, Kenney said, adding, “We’re very Temple proud.” Set to be run by military medical personnel, it will be the second facility in the region to be mounted by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency; on Friday, state lawmakers announced that the Glen Mills Schools campus in Delaware County — empty after revelations of abuse — is also slated to become a medical station. The Holiday Inn Express at 13th and Walnut Streets will open fully this weekend as a quarantine site for people experiencing homelessness and others. It has already hosted some city employees, Abernathy said. The city is continuing to search for other space. Other cities plan to use convention centers as hospital overflow space, including the Javits Center in New York and the Atlantic City Convention Center. But there are no current plans to use the Pennsylvania Convention Center as hospital space, said president and CEO John McNichol on Friday. Conversations with the city are continuing, but “our focus is on getting back to business as soon as possible so we can save jobs,” he said. There are coronavirus cases throughout Philadelphia, city data released Friday showed, with fewer than five cases in some zip codes and as many as 35 in others. As of Friday evening, city data showed West Philadelphia, with 35 cases in 19143, and Queen Village, with 33 cases in 19147, had the highest numbers. Approximately 40% of all intensive-care hospital beds are still available statewide, Levine said Friday. There are 3,400 ICU beds and 3,600 ventilators in the state, the use of which is being tracked by officials. The state is requesting and purchasing more supplies as it works on “contingency plans” for hospitals that may run out of beds and equipment when the case count surges. Officials in New Jersey expect to see a high demand for critical care beds by mid-April, state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said Friday. A field hospital was being constructed on Friday at the Meadowlands Convention Center in Secaucus and should be ready within a week to serve as a general facility for treating both coronavirus patients and others, officials said. Murphy extended a plea to anyone with any medical training from New Jersey or elsewhere: please enlist to help. “We need to call for experienced backup,” he said, calling on retired doctors and nurses, as well as medical students and EMTs, to volunteer their services through the state. “We need to go to the bullpen.” As the state hopes to receive supplies requested from the federal government, Murphy also ordered all business and non-hospital health-care facilities to disclose any inventory of masks and other personal protective equipment to the state by Friday evening. All elective surgeries were to be canceled statewide, also beginning Friday evening. Other provisions to help life continue amid the pandemic came in two laws Wolf signed Friday, one to officially set the state’s presidential primary date as June 2, and one decreeing that Pennsylvania schools must make “good faith efforts” to continue educating students during the ongoing school closures. While Pennsylvania has not required school districts to provide instruction, the new law requires districts and charter schools to post “continuity of education” plans on their websites and submit the plans to the state Department of Education. Developing those plans is “the biggest challenge in front of” school districts right now, said Mark DiRocco, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. He said school leaders are considering whether they are “going to move ahead and teach new content and material,” or focus on review and enrichment activities.  The counties added to Wolf’s stay-at-home order Friday were Berks, Butler, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Luzerne, Pike, Wayne, Westmoreland, and York. The order took effect at 8 p.m. Friday, and will remain in place until April 6. Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Erie, Lehigh, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia Counties are already under the stay-at-home order, which directs residents to leave their homes only for essential items such as groceries and medicine. “I cannot express my gratitude enough to the medical professionals who will be fighting this virus on the front lines,"" Wolf said Thursday. ""When we choose to stay home, we’re thanking a medical professional.” Contributing to this article were staff writers Susan Snyder, Maddie Hanna, Jeremy Roebuck, Vinny Vella, Anna Orso, Julia Terruso, Rob Tornoe, Marie McCullough, and Lisa Gartner, as well as Angela Couloumbis and Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA.

212,State budgets will be reeling from coronavirus — but there may be lessons for next time | Editorial,"The public health and economic crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic are unprecedented. While the virus will ultimately be reduced if not entirely eliminated, the economic tremors will continue. Many businesses and industries will recover and jobs and livelihoods will be restored, but many states and cities are going to be reeling for some time. Countless businesses are closed, hundreds of thousands of people in both states are out of work, and the costs of the deadliest pandemic in memory are mounting. The impact on current and proposed budgets — let alone the effect on essential public services — is difficult to gauge, as is the likely rise in the number of those qualifying for Medicaid, food stamps, and other safety net supports. But last week, a Spotlight PA story in The Inquirer quoted a national tax expert describing Pennsylvania as “particularly ill-prepared” for the pandemic’s fiscal consequences. That’s due to a few factors. One is long-term budgetary policy choices. For example, the closure of casinos and the loss of that gaming revenue is likely to be painful for Pennsylvania, whose gambling-related tax revenue is about five times that of New Jersey’s — though still relatively small as a percentage of the overall budget. The closing of state liquor stores in Pennsylvania will also have an impact on revenues. And when many people lose their jobs, high unemployment figures don’t only mean heavier demands on all social services, but a reduction in income tax revenue — and that’s pain that both Pennsylvania and Philadelphia will feel far more than New Jersey, at least in the short term. The choices state leaders make when times are good have a direct impact on what happens when times are bad. After the 2008 crash decimated revenues and hiked demand for services in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, then-Govs. Ed Rendell and Jon Corzine each were able to tap more than $700 million on hand in their respective rainy day funds. Until recently, none of their successors had replenished so much as a penny. Pennsylvania did manage to build a reserve fund recently, but at $340 million, it’s only sufficient to cover government operations for three days, according to the Spotlight PA report. Last year, Moody’s Analytics found that a typical state needs to have 11% of its budget in reserve. Pennsylvania has around 2%. No amount of prudence, rainy day funding, or mathematical modeling could have prepared us for what’s happening. But solid credit ratings enable governments to obtain more favorable interest rates when revenues fall, spending is cut, and borrowing increases, as typically occurs during an economic downturn. While adjectives like typical may not yet apply in the current crisis, the massive mobilization of public and private resources finally underway in the United States will bring the spread of the virus under control. Even while state leaders figure out how to manage and respond with the help taxpayers need, it’s not too soon for Pennsylvania and New Jersey to start rethinking their budgeting priorities and taxation policies going forward.

The public facility in Avondale, five miles south of Longwood Gardens along Route 1, was believed to be the only course in Southeastern Pennsylvania where golfers were able to play. In the Poconos, Jack Frost National Golf Club also said it had the same permission. It was booked solid Friday, its first reopened day. But a state official suggested the courses may have interpreted the approval too broadly. “Golf course waivers are limited to maintenance,” Dominique Lockett, a Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) spokesperson, said in an email. — Frank Fitzpatrick // Timestamp 03/28 00:54am In Montgomery County, officials are working on a creative solution to get cloth masks to people in the community who may be at high-risk of contracting the virus. County Board of Commissioners Chair Valerie Arkoosh said that while the county doesn’t have enough medical-grade masks to provide members of the community with individually, the county is working with faith leaders to establish a mask exchange portal to connect people sewing masks with those who need them. She said it will hopefully be up and running by next week. Arkoosh said cloth masks can be effective for people making trips to the doctor's office or to the grocery store, especially if they are already practicing social distancing and staying six feet away from others. — Anna Orso // Timestamp 03/27 10:23pm An employee at a Whole Foods Market in Jenkintown has tested positive for the coronavirus, the company said Friday night. “The safety of our Team Members and customers is our top priority and we are diligently following all guidance from local health and food safety authorities,” Whole Foods said in a statement. “We’ve been working closely with our store Team Members, and are supporting the diagnosed Team Member, who is in quarantine.” Whole Foods did not say when the employee last worked at the store, which is located at 1575 The Fairway. The company said the store has undergone additional cleaning and disinfection and that employees are following social distancing guidelines.  — Ellie Rushing // Timestamp 03/27 09:33pm New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal urged residents and business owners to follow Gov. Phil Murphy’s emergency orders to stay indoors, warning that those who don’t comply could face criminal charges. Grewal said that police are “being called upon far too often to deal with people violating the orders put in place to protect us all — or what is more egregious, people falsely using the coronavirus to spread fear or impede officers in their vital work.” In a news release Friday, Grewal highlighted some recent action taken against people who spit or coughed on others, including law enforcement officers, and then falsely claimed they had the coronavirus. Many were charged with disorderly persons offenses for hosting large gatherings, like weddings. A 23-year-old woman was charged with false public alarm for allegedly calling emergency dispatchers and claiming she had the coronavirus to try to get Essex County College to close.

Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks, Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus that has shuttered schools, closed businesses and brought American life in many places to a virtual standstill. “This will deliver urgently needed relief,"" Trump said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office, flanked only by Republican lawmakers.

He made the announcement on the heels of reports that federal officials had reached a standstill with GM over the cost of making the ventilators and how long it would take to make them. The White House had been in talks with GM and Ventec about using a GM auto electronics plant in Kokomo, Ind. to make the equipment. The timeline to sign a contract with GM and Seattle-based ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems had been moving too slow as the outbreak surged, Trump said at a Friday news conference, adding that “we’re not looking to get into a big deal about price."" ”We didn’t want to play games with them,"" he said. Trump said he had named Peter Navarro, assistant to the president and the director of trade and manufacturing policy, to be the policy coordinator for the Defense Production Act. The president’s announcement Friday came mere hours after he had criticized General Motors and Ford Motor Co. on Twitter, accusing the American carmakers of delaying the production of life-saving ventilators in the fight against the coronavirus. Moments later, GM announced official plans to manufacture the FDA-cleared equipment at its plant in Indiana. The Detroit-based company also said it would begin making FDA-approved surgical masks in Michigan. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!,” Trump tweeted. “FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!” The president said the U.S. produces around 29,000 ventilators annually. Over the next 100 days, he said, his administration would want 100,000 more ventilators. — Katie Park, Oona Goodin-Smith // Timestamp 03/27 03:59pm Health care workers already deal with disproportionately high rates of depression — about three times higher than the general public. But the strain of treating coronavirus patients, and the impossible decisions many are being forced to make, will likely worsen the mental health of doctors and nurses, experts say. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open earlier this week, health care workers in China reported experiencing declining mental health as a result of treating patients with COVID-19. The study measured 1,257 responses to surveys used to asses mental health symptoms and found that approximately 50% of participants experienced depressive symptoms; 45% experienced anxiety; 34% experienced insomnia; and 72% experienced distress. — Bethany Ao // Timestamp 03/27 03:49pm The Environmental Protection Agency indefinitely relaxed the enforcement of environmental laws Thursday, allowing companies to effectively regulate themselves during the coronavirus pandemic. Under the sweeping new policy, which has been applied retroactively to March 13, companies won’t face penalties for failing to comply with reporting and monitoring rules on air and water pollution. The oil and gas industry were among the industries that had sought an advance relaxation of environmental and public health enforcement during the outbreak, according to the Associated Press, citing potential staffing problems. “This temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. The move has garnered widespread criticism from environmental groups. Former Obama EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, now the president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the announcement “an open license to pollute.” — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 03:32pm Montgomery County reported its fourth death Friday, a 95-year-old man from Cheltenham Township who had been hospitalized. The county also reported 58 new confirmed cases of coronavirus across 30 municipalities, bringing the area’s total to 371, said Valerie Arkoosh, chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. The newly diagnosed individuals range in age from 12 to 85 years old. Three municipalities reported their first cases. One of the new individuals is hospitalized, 39 are recovering at home, and 18 individuals’ conditions are unknown, Arkoosh said. She said that people who want to be tested at the county sites must now register for an appointment beginning at 8 a.m. the morning of the test. Previously, appointments could be made the night before. Arkoosh, who is a physician with a background in public health, stressed that because the county has a limited number of tests available, people with mild symptoms and no underlying conditions do not need to be tested. — Ellie Rushing // Timestamp 03/27 03:19pm When Comcast CEO Brian Roberts read that Superintendent William R.

In New York City, a doctor at a hospital with 13 deaths in one day told the New York Times just days ago that the situation was “apocalyptic.” Philadelphia area hospitals are now preparing for “the surge.” That’s a medical term referring not just to the deluge of patients, but also to how hospitals plan to do the near-impossible: provide adequate care without adequate resources. “We anticipate we are no more than two weeks behind New York City,” P.J. Brennan, chief medical officer of the massive University of Pennsylvania Health System, said on Thursday. “Cases are doubling every two to three days. We had 46 confirmed cases last night. You do the math.” — Marie McCullough, Lisa Gartner // Timestamp 03/27 02:25pm Pennsylvania reported 531 new coronavirus cases Friday, similar to the rise seen on Thursday. But it’s too early to make any conclusions about what that means, Health Secretary Rachel Levine said at a news conference, adding that the state is still seeing an exponential rise in cases. Unlike officials in other states, she declined to estimate when Pennsylvania will see a peak in cases. Instead, Levine emphasized ongoing mitigation efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. — Sarah Anne Hughes // Timestamp 03/27 02:20pm Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday said he is expanding his stay-at-home order to another nine counties, bringing the total of counties under some form of lockdown to 19. Wolf said the new counties where residents are being asked to limit their movements are Berks, Butler, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Luzerne, Pike, Wayne, Westmoreland, and York. The order takes effect 8:00 p.m. Friday, and will remain in place until April 6. Counties already under a stay-at-home order are: Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Erie, Lehigh, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia. Wolf has said he’s taking a “measured” approach to the order, which directs residents to leave their homes only for essential items, such as groceries and medicine. He has said he is not, as of now, considering extending the order statewide. — Angela Couloumbis // Timestamp 03/27 02:14pm New Jersey saw its deadliest day yet during the coronavirus outbreak as 27 people died Friday, bringing the state’s total number of fatalities in the pandemic to 108. As state health officials warned that the peak is likely weeks away, Gov. Phil Murphy extended a plea to anyone with any medical training, from New Jersey or elsewhere: please enlist to help. “We need to call for experienced backup,” he said. “We need to go to the bullpen.” He called on retired doctors and nurse, as well as medical students and EMTs, to volunteer their service through the state. By mid-April, officials expect to see a high demand for critical care beds, state health director Judith M. Persichilli said. Murphy said he believes the current way of life may extend “meaningfully into May.”In all, the state has 8,825 total confirmed cases. Since Thursday, that’s an increase of 1,982 cases, a number that is less than the increase from the previous day. Coronavirus cases have been reported at 55 long-term-care facilities, he said. — Erin McCarthy // Timestamp 03/27 01:58pm Bucks County officials said they should know in a matter of days whether social distancing measures are working to slow the spread of the coronavirus. On Friday, the county saw a slight decrease in the number of new confirmed cases — 16 new cases as opposed to 18 a day earlier, health director David Damsker said. However, when determining whether social distancing is working, Damsker said a better indicator is how many of the cases come from families or households where other individuals have the coronavirus. So far, he said, most of the county’s 144 cases fall into that category. A second Bucks County emergency responder has tested positive, but officials declined to provide additional details, including where and for what department he or she works. The Middletown Township police officer who tested positive last week is “recovering well” at home,” Damsker said. Of the county’s 144 cases, 10 have resulted in hospitalization, with four people in critical condition and six people in serious but not critical condition. On the economic front, the county saw a 200% increase in unemployment this week. To help residents, officials have moved the deadline for paying property taxes without a late fee from July 1 to July 31. — Erin McCarthy // Timestamp 03/27 01:51pm Closed indefinitely from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Franklin Institute Thursday laid off all of its part-time staff and 36% of its full-time staff across all departments, according to officials at the institute on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. In an unsigned statement, the institute said the large cuts were made to help ensure financial stability. Many remaining staffers will take pay cuts ranging up to 30% — with those at the top of the scale facing the largest reductions. Those making less than $50,000 a year will not face any salary reduction. — Stephan Salisbury // Timestamp 03/27 01:32pm The House easily passed a massive $2.2 trillion stimulus package intended to help businesses and workers cope with the economic impacts of the coronavirus epidemic. The bill passed by voice vote Friday afternoon, with many lawmakers absent due to travel concerns, shelter-in-place rules, or because they are in self-isolation due to COVID-19 encounters. The Senate passed the legislation with a 96-0 vote early Thursday morning, which among other things includes direct payments to most Americans and a $600 increase in unemployment benefits for impacted individuals for at least four months. President Trump is expected to quickly sign the legislation into law, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he expects direct payments of $1,200 to most individuals and $2,400 to most married couples to be in bank accounts by mid-April. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 01:31pm Managing Director Brian Abernathy said Friday an inmate in Philadelphia’s prison system has tested positive for the coronavirus. “We do have inmates in quarantine,” he said. “We’re not going to go into specifics of how many or at what facility.” City officials also announced Friday the first case in an employee in the city’s Department of Prisons. The city now has 637 confirmed cases of the virus. — Laura McCrystal // Timestamp 03/27 01:17pm Two additional COVID-19 related deaths were reported in Delaware County on Friday, according to county officials. A 70-year-old woman from Ridley Township and a 63-year-old man from Middletown Township died, doubling the number of deaths in the county. Earlier in the week, a man and woman, both in their 80s, from Delaware County died after being treated for the virus at Main Line Health hospitals. — Vinny Vella // Timestamp 03/27 01:06pm Philadelphia has reached an agreement with Temple University to use the Liacouras Center and other facilities at the college for overflow hospital space if needed. “Materials and supplies will be moving into the Liacouras Center over the next few days,"" Kenney said. Kenney said he hopes that the city will not have to use the Temple facility, which could hold as many as 250 patients, but it will be there if needed. The arrangement includes the Liacouras Center, its parking garage and the student pavilion, an indoor athletic and practice space that is one block north on Broad Street, said Ray Betzner, a Temple University spokesperson. The center would be used for the hospital, and the pavilion for storage. Like in New York, the space will be used to move non-coronavirus patients into and free up space in the hospitals, he said. The Army Corps of Engineers will set up the facility and it will be run by military medical personnel, he said. The agreement was worked out in the last 24 hours, he said. The city and Federal Emergency Management Agency approached the university. Temple President Richard M. Englert was eager to comply, Betzner said. “Temple University is part of the city and this is a fight that everyone in the city needs to enter,” Betzner said. “And Temple was happy to be a part of it.” Temple owns the center, but it is operated by Comcast Spectacor, which also is part of the agreement. The city hopes that FEMA will help staff the facility with health care workers, he said, but officials are looking into other options if that does not come through. Kenney said the city is not paying Temple anything for the use of the facilities. “We’re very Temple proud,” he said. Philadelphia is continuing to search for other facilities in addition to the Liacouras Center and the Holiday Inn Express at 13th and Walnut, which will be used as a quarantine site. The Holiday Inn has already hosted some city employees, and will be fully operational this weekend, Abernathy said. Other cities plan to use convention centers as hospital overflow space, including the Javits Center in New York and the Atlantic City Convention Center. John McNichol, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Convention Center, said they continue to have conversations with the city regarding the use of the space, but no decisions have been made. “Our focus is on getting back to business as soon as possible so we can save jobs,” he said. In terms of being used as a hospital overflow space, McNichol said: “We’re trying to be as nimble as possible. Right now there’s no plan to use the Convention Center for that purpose.” — Laura McCrystal, Susan Snyder, Anna Orso // Timestamp 03/27 00:43pm Pennsylvania schools must make “good faith efforts” to continue educating students during the ongoing closures, under a law signed by Gov. Tom Wolf Friday. While Pennsylvania has not required school districts to provide instruction, the new law requires districts to post “continuity of education” plans on their websites and submit the plans to the state Department of Education. The requirement also applies to charter schools. Developing those plans is “the biggest challenge in front of” school districts right now, said Mark DiRocco, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators. He said school leaders are considering if they are “going to move ahead and teach new content and material,” or focus on review and enrichment activities. Pennsylvania’s schools are closed at least until April 6, though school leaders have been preparing for the shutdown to last longer as the coronavirus outbreak continues. — Maddie Hanna // Timestamp 03/27 00:33pm As the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, Pope Francis will offer prayers and a special blessing today in an unprecedented service before an empty square outside St. Peter’s Basilica. The Pope’s extraordinary Urbi et Orbi (“from the city to world”) blessing — usually only imparted at Christmas and Easter — will be live-streamed at 1 p.m. Eastern (6 p.m. Rome time) and beamed across the world. The moment of prayer is expected to last about an hour.You can watch the Pope’s service here: — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 00:28pm Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) followed through on his threat to force a full floor vote in the House on the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill Friday. House leaders had hoped to pass the bill by a voice vote, which would have prevented vulnerable members from traveling to Washington, D.C. There is wide, bipartisan support for the legislation, so Massie’s move is only expected to delay the bill’s passage in the House. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 00:25pm Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said Philadelphia has two new deaths due to the coronavirus. One is confirmed, the other is presumed, Farley said. Both were women in their 70s, he said, and one was a nursing home resident. The city now has 637 confirmed cases. The city announced earlier this week that the first city resident known to have died of the coronavirus was a male patient in his 50s with an underlying medical condition. — Laura McCrystal, Anna Orso // Timestamp 03/27 11:50am June 2 is shaping up to be the Super Tuesday of postponed primaries. Pennsylvania will join 11 states and the District of Columbia in voting that day, after rescheduling its primary due to the coronavirus. Gov. Wolf on Friday signed a bill passed through the Pennsylvania legislature to move the primary back six weeks to allow enough time for people to register to vote by mail, for polling locations to shift, and to give election officials time to prepare for an election taking place in unprecedented circumstances. The law also authorizes county election officials to close and consolidate polling places without the usual court approval. (Officials had asked for that flexibility, as they’ve lost polling places and poll workers due to concerns over the coronavirus.) Election officials will also now be able to begin processing absentee ballots earlier instead of after 8 p.m. on Election Day, which could have meant elections would take days to call. With Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland and D.C. also voting June 2, it’s been dubbed the Acela Primary. While the moves are unlikely to derail former Vice President Joe Biden from winning the Democratic nomination, it does mean he’ll need more time to clinch it. Meanwhile, the delay could hurt some candidates running for the state legislature who have limited campaign resources they now need to stretch. For election officials, it’s a welcome extension to prepare for an election that keeps voters and poll workers safe. — Julia Terruso // Timestamp 03/27 11:40am House leaders will attempt to pass the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill by voice vote at noon, but their plans might be upended by Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.), who has said he plans to object and force a full floor vote. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi had hoped to pass the measure without a full floor vote to protect vulnerable members of Congress, some of whom are home in states mandating stay-at-home rules. If Massie or any other member objects, a quorum of 216 lawmakers would be required to vote on the legislation. Several lawmakers from the region, including Rep. Donald Norcross (D., N.J.) and Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R., N.J.), were present on the House floor Friday morning. Pennsylvania Rep Chrissy Houlahan (D., Pa.) drove to Washington, D.C. on Thursday afternoon in case her vote was needed. One local member of congress who won’t take part in a vote is Rep. Andy Kim (D., N.J.), who is in his last day of self-quarantine after coming into contact with a colleague who tested positive for coronavirus. It’s unclear if Massie will follow through on this threat, which has been condemned by politicians from both parties. That includes President Trump, who called for Republicans to throw the Kentucky congressman “out of the Republican Party!” Update, 12:28 p.m.: Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) followed through on his threat to force a full floor vote in the House on the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill Friday. House leaders had hoped to pass the bill by a voice vote, which would have prevented vulnerable members from traveling to Washington, D.C. — Rob Tornoe and Jonathan Tamari // Timestamp 03/27 10:50am Beasley Media Group is instituting company-wide pay cuts and reducing the hours of some employees as the radio company grapples with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Beasley — which owns seven stations in Philadelphia, including 93.3 WMMR and 97.5 The Fanatic — is cutting wages 10% for salaried full-time employees, and reducing hours for full-time hourly workers by 10%. The cuts go into effect April 1 and will continue through the end of June. Most hosts are salaried, meaning they will continue to host their daily shows as usual. “While it is not something we want to do, it is necessary in the long-term as we continue to move forward to get to the other side of the current economic situation,” CEO Caroline Beasley wrote, adding she will be forgoing 20% of her compensation through the end of the second quarter. Media companies, long supported by local advertising, have been hit hard by the COVID-19 outbreak, which has forced governments across the country to close many businesses in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus. Sports stations like The Fanatic and 94.1 WIP, which air live games, have also been hurt by the postponement of professional sports leagues. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 10:20am Megabus has suspended service in and out of New York City, America’s largest coronavirus outbreak hotspot, through at least April 9, the company said in a message on its website. The move was made “in an abundance of caution” and aimed at supporting the federal government’s recommendation that anyone who traveled from New York City self-quarantine for at least two weeks, the company said. All Megabus passengers who have trips booked to and from New York City will receive an email with instructions for how to reschedule. The announcement came shortly after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said Thursday he was considering suspending bus service between New York and Philadelphia, but had not yet made a decision. “Regularly scheduled bus services that are coming in from states where there’s a problem, that does pose an issue that we have to address,” Wolf said. “We’re doing that. Right now, I don’t have an answer.” Other major bus companies including Greyhound and Peter Pan still have service available between Philadelphia and New York City, though both have cut back on trips throughout the Northeast as sales and ridership have plummeted. Amtrak also still offers trips between the two cities, though it canceled nonstop Acela service between Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and New York City about three weeks ago. — Anna Orso, Justine McDaniel // Timestamp 03/27 10:00am A second person has died from the coronavirus in Delaware. An 86-year-old man, who was a resident of a long-term-care facility for low-income seniors in Newark died Thursday night, according to the Delaware Division of Public Health. Six other residents of that facility, the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence, have also tested positive. A 66-year-old man from Sussex County died earlier Thursday while hospitalized out of state. As of Friday morning, there were 143 confirmed coronavirus cases in Delaware, and 15 people had been hospitalized. — Erin McCarthy // Timestamp 03/27 09:50am Most people do recover from the coronavirus, more than 127,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University, which keeps track of the virus and its spread. Corianne Goldstein, a 32-year-old New Jersey woman who was hospitalized after contracting the virus, is on her way to being one of them. Goldstein, of Matawan, was released from Bayshore Medical Center in Holmdel earlier this week and is at home continuing to recover. “It’s nice to be back with my husband and my dogs, having somebody to be next to me for the rest of this journey,” said Goldstein, a Rowan University graduate and marketing professional. Earlier this month, Goldstein broke out in chills and fever, then started coughing and having difficulty breathing. She went to the emergency room on March 17, was diagnosed with double pneumonia and tested positive for the virus. She was discharged Wednesday as the hospital became more crowded, she said. She’s still tired and short of breath, she said, and doctors told her it could take four to six weeks for her to fully recover. Her lung doctor also told her she had some damage to her lungs that will have to be addressed later, she said. “The virus might be gone but the results of what it did to me are not,” she said. Also recovering is Elena Blanc, 31, a graduate of the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, who lives in Brooklyn. She was not hospitalized. Her primary care doctor told her the illness was likely COVID-19. But because of test shortages, and because she doesn’t have underlying conditions that would make her more susceptible to bad outcomes, she was told she would not be tested unless symptoms worsened. “My fever finally went away and my breathing and cough are much better,” Blanc, a full-time graduate student in the economics department at the New School for Social Research, said by email. “It definitely feels like my lung capacity is still less than before and I’m getting tired more easily than normal, but otherwise my symptoms are more or less resolved.” — Susan Synder // Timestamp 03/27 09:40am After three straight days of gains, stocks opened lower on Friday as investors continue to grapple with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down 800 points, about 3.5%, shaking off some of the gains earned in one of the best three-day stretches in stock market history. The Nasdaq opened down about 220 points (about 2.8%), while the S&P 500 opened down about 84 points (about 3.2%). The House is expected to pass the $2.2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill Friday afternoon. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 08:40am House leaders’ plan for swift action on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus economic rescue package ran into complications Friday as a maverick conservative threatened to delay passage until most lawmakers return to Washington for a vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who's opposed to the massive bill, set the House on edge by threatening to try to force a roll call vote. Party leaders had hoped to pass the measure by voice vote without lawmakers having to take the risk of travelling to Washington. Massie took to Twitter to suggest he’d require a quorum of lawmakers — some 216 lawmakers — to be present and voting. Massie didn’t respond to a reporter’s requests for comment. — Associated Press // Timestamp 03/27 08:10am While the coronavirus pandemic has postponed or canceled nearly every major sporting event, the NFL Draft reportedly will go on as scheduled April 23-25. In a memo obtained by ESPN, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said there will be significant changes to the event, including canceling the public spectacle planned outside the Bellagio hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Instead, the NFL has nixed all public events and won’t be bringing top prospects and their families to the event. The draft will be conducted and televised “in a way that reflects current conditions,” Goodell wrote, and told teams to prepare to run their draft operations from a location outside their team facilities. Goodell also warned potential critics of the league’s decision that “public discussion of issues relating to the Draft serves no useful purpose and is grounds for disciplinary action.” — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 07:30am British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the most prominent world leader to contract COVID-19. Johnson wrote on Twitter that he has “mild symptoms” and is self-isolating, but will continue to lead his government’s response to the pandemic remotely. He was tested for coronavirus on the personal advice of England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, according to a statement from Downing Street. The Royal Family announced Wednesday that Prince Charles, heir to the throne, had tested positive for COVID-19. — Rob Tornoe // Timestamp 03/27 06:50am Thousands of businesses in Pennsylvania have closed under Gov. Tom Wolf’s unprecedented statewide shutdown to help slow the spread of coronavirus, but not the company that the Democratic governor once owned, or the business now owned by the Senate’s most powerful member. Until now. On Thursday, Wolf’s office said it had rescinded a waiver that had been issued to the governor’s former business, a kitchen and bath cabinet supply company in Central Pennsylvania, after Spotlight PA and PA Post inquired about how it qualified as “life-sustaining."" Likewise, The Dan Smith Candy Company, owned by Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson) — which makes and sells candies, chocolates and other specialty items at stores in the northern part of the state — also closed its doors after inquiries from the news organizations. — Angela Couloumbis of Spotlight PA and Ed Mahon of PA Post // Timestamp 03/27 05:15am Sidney Greenberger runs a New Jersey-based company that operates eight nursing homes in Pennsylvania and six in New Jersey. His buildings are filled with those most likely to die if infected with the coronavirus — the elderly and those with lots of chronic health problems. He finds the prospect “terrifying” and says the virus could make nursing homes a “death trap” for his residents. “I’m scared s—less, and that’s the honest truth,"" he said. — Stacey Burling // Timestamp 03/27 05:00am Temple University refunded millions of dollars to students who were forced to leave their dorms and return home to finish the semester online. There’s also money gone from canceled campus events and a loss of sports-related revenue. Many other questions swirl: Will the coronavirus affect summer and fall terms? Will students feel safe to enroll? Will their families, who may face job loss, be able to pay? Will the campus be able to open? Will it have to shut again for a second virus wave? Temple said it couldn’t estimate how much money it has lost already — or could lose in coming months. Pennsylvania State University president Eric Barron said during a virtual town hall his school also faces a loss of millions. The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, which oversees 14 universities, is projecting a $100 million revenue shortfall. — Susan Snyder // Timestamp 03/27 04:45am A 65-year-old American Airlines flight attendant based in Philadelphia died this week after testing positive for COVID-19. Paul Frishkorn started as a flight attendant in 1997, the airline said in a statement late Thursday night. “Over the years he built a reputation as a consummate professional who was honored as one of American’s Flight Service Champions twice for his excellent service to our customers,” the airline said. “Our hearts go out to Paul’s loved ones, many of whom work for American,"" the company saud. ""We are working directly with them to ensure they are cared for during this extraordinarily difficult time. He will be missed by the customers he cared for and everyone at American who worked with him.” Frishkorn reportedly had other health issues that made him susceptible to complications from COVID-19. “Paul was 65 years old and the first American team member to lose his life after contracting the illness,” the Association of Flight Professional Attendants said in an online memoriam. “Our industry, our airline and all of us have been affected by COVID-19 in different ways. But until now, we hadn’t lost one of our own. This loss hits home in a very different, personal way from the headlines,” the union said. American Airlines, the dominant carrier at Philadelphia International Airport, has been economically devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, as has the airline industry globally. — Robert Moran // Timestamp 03/27 04:15am As preparations — and a race against time — continued for the anticipated strain of the coronavirus on hospitals, New Jersey was declared a major disaster area by President Donald Trump, and officials across Pennsylvania scrambled Thursday to find hospital space and much-needed supplies to care for the growing number of ill people. The New Jersey health commissioner warned that the state was nearing the patient surge officials have been trying to combat, and ordered three major hospitals across the state to help mount field hospitals in the coming weeks. The state put in another order for supplies from the federal government, seeking 4.5 million N95 masks and 2,500 ventilators. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania officials said they were “scouring the state and the country” to find any medical supplies available for purchase, and Gov. Tom Wolf said the state needs more beds and ventilators “as soon as possible.” — Justine McDaniel, Pranshu Verma and Laura McCrystal The Inquirer Front Page // Timestamp 03/27 04:00am ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,N2TFHFU6R5HYJGAIMFGDFYF2KU
214,"Will coronavirus undermine democracies? Consider Israel, Hungary, and the U.S. | Trudy Rubin","Early last year, Daniel Ziblatt coauthored a New York Times op-ed titled “Why Autocrats Love Emergencies.” His thesis now has great relevance in the time of the coronavirus. “Crises offer … would-be authoritarians an escape from constitutional shackles,” Ziblatt argued with fellow Harvard prof Steven Levitsky (with whom he wrote the influential book How Democracies Die). Think of the autocrat wannabes among today’s democratic leaders who have shown great impatience with checks on their power, such as Donald Trump, Israel’s Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu, and Hungary’s Viktor Orban. With emergency measures in place, it’s easy to imagine their temptation to expand personal power at the top. And yet, a few months into the crisis, the picture is far more complicated. Rather than veer toward authoritarianism, many Western leaders — including Trump — have been surprisingly passive. Others like Netanyahu and Orban have used the virus as an excuse to continue their longtime assault on democratic norms. Israel is a particularly fascinating case, where three elections in a row had failed to produce a viable majority to form a new government, despite the health crisis. Facing trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, with opposition leaders calling on him to step down, Netanyahu used the coronavirus as an excuse to shut courts, in the dead of night. This conveniently delayed his trial for two months. He also authorized Israel’s internal security services to use massive amounts of cellphone data secretly collected to combat terrorism to track coronavirus carriers for 30 days, without the approval of parliament. While many countries are using cellphone data to track the virus, Israel is apparently the only democracy using its security forces to do so. However, it looked until this week as if there was political pushback against Netanyahu’s machinations: The opposition had cobbled together a bare majority coalition and was set to take control of parliament, despite efforts by leaders of Netanyahu’s party to defy the green light from Israel’s High Court. It seemed that democracy had prevailed. Yet, with the skill that has kept him in office since 2009, Netanyahu managed on Thursday to split the opposition and remain in power. Benny Gantz, the opposition leader, was neatly outmaneuvered, agreeing to serve under Netanyahu. Bibi said he was acting at a time of health crisis that demanded “unity” under his leadership. In Israel, we see a case of a complex democracy with a leader who regularly breaks democratic norms and has shown he will use the virus crisis to obtain his goals. Hungary is a simpler case – one of several countries in central and southeastern Europe that have yet to fully adopt democratic norms. Foremost among their leaders, Orban has taken control of courts, parliament, and media. Now he is pushing through a draft law that will give the executive branch dictatorial powers for an unlimited period. It would be known as the “law to protect against the coronavirus.” Other troubled democracies could follow his lead. And then we come to the United States, where the president sees checks and balances as an annoyance and constantly attacks the courts, the fact-based media, and Democratic political leaders. At a time of crisis, and health emergency, what might happen? Civil liberties advocates were concerned when news broke that the Justice Department had asked Congress for permission to ask senior judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies – as part of a push for new powers during the epidemic. But lo and behold, a bipartisan group of legislators rejected this idea. The chief strategist for Rand Paul (R., Ky.) tweeted in agreement with a strong critique from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) tweeted, “OVER MY DEAD BODY.” And despite his insistence that he is a “war president,” Trump has been resistant to acting like one. He has set no national strategy, left states mostly to fend for themselves, and refused to make serious use of the Defense Production Act to force private and defense industry to produce desperately needed health equipment. He has deferred to health experts even as he has disdained expert advice for the last three years. “National crises, including epidemics, provide opportunity for leaders who want to consolidate power to do that,” Ziblatt told me. “What’s puzzling is why Trump responded by being quite passive.” His thesis: “It reflects a strong democratic opposition, with a small d, and constraints built into the system. Federalism is a kind of constraint on the ability to consolidate power.” I’d add that it reflects a president who is more adept at reality TV than leading the country, and a civil society that is providing brave first responders even as the national government fails to provide them with masks. The story is not over, especially if the health crisis gets worse. The coronavirus could provide an excuse for voter suppression in the 2020 election. But bottom line: While COVID-19 exacerbates existing problems in democracies, it doesn’t provide the formula for a takeover — provided the public and the system push back.

215,What it’s like to be locked in prison during the coronavirus pandemic,"At the Pike County Correctional Facility, a contraband economy has sprung up around limited supplies of soap. Fights have broken out between prisoners in Montgomery County over phone time since the state prisons banned visitors. Inmate trustees in Schuylkill County have logged 12-hour shifts fulfilling thousands of commissary orders from peers stockpiling what they could before their detention center went into lockdown. And at least 180 immigration detainees in the York County Prison launched a hunger strike over the weekend. Though public health advocates, defense lawyers, and even some prosecutors have been raising alarm for weeks about the risk of a coronavirus outbreak among Pennsylvania’s incarcerated population, it is only in the last several days that a snapshot has begun to emerge of what life is like for the tens of thousands of people living and working in the state’s prisons, county jails, and immigration lockups amid the pandemic. Court filings, interviews, and social media postings detail an increasingly tense environment — one in which close quarters makes social distancing all but impossible, and where daily contact between on-edge inmates and concerned guards has led to a growing sense that widespread exposure is inevitable. “I cannot sleep. I cannot breathe, and I feel like I’m going to die,” wrote Mayowa Abayomi Oyediran, an asthmatic Nigerian asylum seeker housed in the York County Prison, in a sworn affidavit last week. “Nobody in here can even get me an inhaler. How can they save us from this virus?” Until a federal judge in Harrisburg ordered his release Tuesday, Oyediran, 40, had been housed in a cell block packed with as many as 60 other inmates — using the same rarely cleaned six toilets and showers, eating shoulder to shoulder, and sleeping at night in bunks so close together he could reach out and touch his cellmate on the other side. Inmates in other facilities have described similar conditions, and worry about guards showing up to work with suspicious coughs and fellow prisoners who have recently developed fevers. At SCI Phoenix in Collegeville, some inmates have resorted to makeshift masks “almost the size of a diaper” for protection, said Thomas Schilk, who is serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. Meanwhile, Matthew Stiegler, an attorney who represents a 69-year-old inmate seeking release from the federal detention center at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, said inmates there were recently called to a town hall meeting with more than 100 people in a communal hall. The guards told them they were planning to put more hand soap in the restrooms — sometime in the future. “It’s a scene out of a Hollywood disaster movie,” he said. In many ways, advocates say, the characteristics that have long defined life in custody — shared cells, communal bathrooms, a lack of freedom of movement — are the very conditions that make such facilities vulnerable to a fast-moving and easily communicable virus. “It is impossible for me to stay six feet away from other people,” wrote Christopher Aubry, who is serving a one- to 23-month sentence for simple assault in the Montgomery County prisonl, in a court affidavit Monday. But corrections officials at the state, local, and federal level have resisted calls for widespread releases of low-level offenders or those most at risk for infection, and said such moves could pose a public safety risk. They contend that prison staff are fully equipped to manage inmates’ health and are taking all possible precautions to prevent an outbreak within their walls. The Philadelphia Department of Prisons has begun quarantining newly admitted jail inmates for 14 days, and anyone entering its facilities is screened for temperature and possible coronavirus symptoms. In federal prisons, new arrivals are monitored for coughs or fevers, and officials have temporarily banned personal and most legal visits. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, meanwhile, which oversees about 45,000 inmates in the state, placed its entire system under quarantine late Sunday after a prisoner tested positive at SCI Phoenix.  “I don't want to wait until we have several cases in our system to act,” Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said in a statement. “We're taking this proactive measure now."" That may not be enough. On Monday, the ACLU of Pennsylvania petitioned the state Supreme Court, pushing for immediate release of five inmates with underlying medical conditions that would make them most at risk. Lawyers argued that it is only a matter of time before a crisis erupts like the one unfolding at New York City’s Rikers Island, where at least 300 inmates and staff have tested positive. The facility’s chief doctor described the situation as “a public health disaster unfolding before our eyes.” Three Pennsylvania state prison system guards had tested positive for the virus as of Tuesday. And officials in Philadelphia reported Friday that at least one prisoner and one guard have been infected in the city’s jails, while at least five others have been quarantined. They declined to provide an updated tally Tuesday. Montgomery and Delaware Counties have identified cases among staff and inmates as well. Meanwhile, the union representing the state’s corrections officers continues to raise concern about continued nonessential transfers from county jails to prisons, which can expose even the most tightly regulated facilities to possible exposure from new arrivals, said union president Larry Blackwell. The problems plaguing prisons and jails are only exacerbated in immigration detention centers, where some inmates don’t speak English fluently, frustrating efforts to educate prisoners on steps they can take to protect themselves. Meijing Lin, 45, sought asylum in the United States after being forcibly sterilized by the Chinese government, and was housed in a pod at the York County prison with 50 to 60 other inmates while awaiting a hearing. She sensed the anxiety levels rising all month among her fellow inmates and guards. But as a Mandarin speaker, she said, she understood very little of it. “If they are giving advice on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, I don’t know what it is,” she said in a translated federal court affidavit seeking her release last week. Courtney Stubbs, a 52-year-old Jamaican man under a deportation order in the Pike County Correctional Facility after a drug-related conviction, said his panic kicked in when one day the television in the detention center’s rec room suddenly switched from its usual CNN to Netflix. “We used to ask the COs to put on Netflix to watch movies all the time, and they wouldn’t do it,” he wrote. “Now it’s the only thing they put on. I feel like they did this so we wouldn’t get information about the coronavirus” in the outside world. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Harrisburg described Stubbs’ report of guards limiting information as “troubling,” and ruled that there were no precautions that federal immigration authorities could reasonably take to protect inmates like him with high-risk medical conditions. He ordered the immediate release of Stubbs, Lin, and eight other medically vulnerable immigrant detainees, saying it would be “unconscionable” and “barbaric” not to do so. But at least one of them, in court filings, worried it might be too late. A hacking cough from his cellmate in a bed three feet away kept Bharatkumar G. Thakker, 61, of India, awake for nights before the judge’s order led to his release from the Pike County Correctional Facility on Tuesday. Last week, Thakker started coughing himself.

216,Glen Mills Schools will be turned into a medical treatment site to ease the coronavirus crush,"WASHINGTON — The closed Glen Mills Schools, now notorious for abusing children, could soon be turned into a federal medical station to help doctors cope with a potential regional overflow of patients caused by the coronavirus. Timothy Boyce, the head of Delaware County’s Department of Emergency Services, said Thursday that state and federal authorities had approved the school’s conversion, and that equipment was expected to begin arriving at Glen Mills on Friday. “There are no borders in this pandemic,” Boyce said. “Delaware County has been planning for this as a region, and we’re capable of hosting this facility. We’re not hopeful for it, but we are grateful to be able to play this role.” Over the last few days, discussions between Boyce and his counterparts across Southeastern Pennsylvania centered on where to establish a medical shelter to help ease the burden on area hospitals. Boyce said the shuttered school was an obvious choice: Two of its buildings are “shovel-ready,” meeting the requirements set by the federal government for space and utilities. Additionally, the nearly 800-acre school has ample room for helicopters to land, which would allow any medical shelter installed there to serve other nearby counties, including parts of the state of Delaware. “It’s really a matter of where to place sensitive people as these cases continue to mount,” Boyce said. “And since Glen Mills is an existing facility, we’re not displacing anyone.” The Army Corps of Engineers visited the school this week, followed by the Pennsylvania State Police and federal Department of Homeland Security, representatives of which gave the final security approval late Thursday. Earlier in the day, a bipartisan group of local lawmakers, led by Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D., Pa.) of Delaware County, wrote to the Federal Emergency Management Agency asking for approval of the site as a federal emergency station. Joining Scanlon were Pennsylvania Democrats Sen. Bob Casey, Rep. Dwight Evans, and Rep. Madeleine Dean and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, and Republicans Sen. Pat Toomey and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. “Based on the observed progression of COVID-19, we expect that hospitals in our region will require significant assistance from a Federal Medical Station in order to provide high quality care to our constituents,” the group wrote to FEMA. The Delaware County campus, shuttered after an Inquirer investigation exposed a pattern of abuse at the once-prestigious reform academy, could be used as a medical center to host noncritical patients and free up space at medical facilities swamped by coronavirus cases, according to Scanlon’s office. It may be used, for example, for patients who don’t have critical needs but are at critical care hospitals, or those who are stable but too ill to be discharged. Christopher Spriggs, Glen Mills’ acting executive director, said in a statement Thursday that the school was eager to help the efforts, and committed to host the facility for as long as it’s needed. “We have a campus that is being underutilized and want to step up and be a resource for the community as well as partner to the broader region,” Spriggs said. The school has already been repurposed as a hub for volunteers to distribute supplies, coordinate communication and provide a place for first responders who have been exposed to the virus.

The nation’s death toll has surpassed 1,000, the third-highest count globally, behind only China and Italy. The majority of people who have died in Pennsylvania were older than 65. 🚓 Five Philadelphia police officers have tested positive for coronavirus. 💰The Greater Philadelphia YMCA laid off most of its workforce, cutting 4,000 jobs in what appears to be the largest mass layoff in the state so far during the coronavirus pandemic. 🛑President Donald Trump declared New Jersey a major disaster area. The state remains second in the nation, behind New York, for the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. 👐The Trump administration is developing new social distancing guidelines. 📈 As of Thursday evening, there are more than 1,000 reported cases in the Philadelphia area. Track the spread here. If coronavirus cases continue to rise as a rapid rate, the state could face a ventilator shortage, forcing doctors to make tough decisions: “which critically ill COVID-19 patients will get access to life-saving technology and which will not,” my colleagues Jason Laughlin and Wendy Ruderman report. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the state has about 1,900 ventilators and asked federal authorities for another 2,500. Through hospitals and Emergency Medical Services, the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported 3,600 ventilators available, which is less than what may be needed if illnesses peak, according to a Harvard study.  New Jersey’s triage policy is being crafted while Pennsylvania has an interim policy, which has not been made public, about what to do in this situation. The draft guidelines, according to Arvind Venkat, a Pennsylvania emergency physician who has seen them, include priorities based on the likelihood of a person’s recovery. “It’s a combination of how critically ill a patient is and determining how long and whether they would benefit from ventilator treatment and prognosis over the short, medium, or long term,” Venkat said. Many of you will soon receive money from the federal government once the House passes the $2.2 trillion stimulus package to help businesses, workers, and health care systems. The economic fallout from the pandemic has been far reaching, with businesses closing, workers being laid off, and a record 3.2 million Americans filing jobless claims. So how much will you get paid? Do you need to apply? When will you get your money? These are some of the questions my colleague Christian Hetrick addresses. The short answer, you don’t need to apply and the payments will come as early as April, but could also take as long as four months. As for the amount, if you are single with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less, you’ll get $1,200. Those filing as the head of a household and earning up to $112,500 would get that amount too. And if you’re married and together make up to $150,000, you would get $2,400. For every $100 you make over those thresholds, you’ll get $5 less. The payments stop once you are making more than $99,000 as an individual, $146,500 as head-of-household, and $198,000 as a married couple. 🐶An unusual heart procedure saved Sophie the boxer.

218,"Pa. officials look for supplies and space amid coronavirus ‘war,’ New Jersey pronounced major disaster area","As preparations — and a race against time — continued for the anticipated strain of the coronavirus on hospitals, New Jersey was declared a major disaster area by President Donald Trump, and officials across Pennsylvania scrambled Thursday to find hospital space and much-needed supplies to care for the growing number of ill people. The New Jersey health commissioner warned that the state was nearing the patient surge officials have been trying to combat, and ordered three major hospitals across the state to help mount field hospitals in the coming weeks. The state put in another order for supplies from the federal government, seeking 4.5 million N95 masks and 2,500 ventilators. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania officials said they were “scouring the state and the country” to find any medical supplies available for purchase, and Gov. Tom Wolf said the state needs more beds and ventilators “as soon as possible.” New Jersey was approaching 7,000 cases of the coronavirus, with 81 people dead, and Pennsylvania neared 1,700 cases on Thursday. The number of new cases reported in Pennsylvania Thursday — 560 positive tests — was double the number reported Wednesday. Delaware reported its first coronavirus death Thursday, a 66-year-old man from Sussex County who was hospitalized out of state. The state tallied 130 cases, most in New Castle County. Eleven of the 16 people who have died from the coronavirus in Pennsylvania were over age 65, Health Secretary Rachel Levine said. Montgomery County reported its third death and 313 cases. Bucks County had 107 cases, Chester County had 84, and Delaware County had 156. Of all patients in the commonwealth, 39% are between the ages of 25 and 49; Levine warned younger adults “not to be complacent” about the virus. Montgomery County Commissioners Chair Val Arkoosh, a physician, reminded residents in their 20s and 30s to stay home. “If you expose others, your parents, a coworker, or someone who’s immunocompromised, the chances of them being hospitalized are much higher,” Arkoosh said. “This is why we have to pull together as a community and work together to stay home. That’s how we’ll beat this disease.” By Thursday evening, the United States had confirmed more coronavirus cases than any other country, surpassing China and Italy with more than 82,400 virus patients. The death toll of the virus in the U.S. topped 1,000 Thursday as Americans awaited a stimulus package set for a House vote Friday. As deaths and cases mounted in disaster-struck New York, health officials in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey had begun preparing guidelines for doctors to decide which coronavirus patients get life-saving care in the event of supply shortages. In New Jersey, where the state has 1,900 ventilators and has requested 2,500 more from the federal government, the disaster declaration handed down by Trump should allow the state to get additional money and resources to fight the disease. “We will now have access to greater, essential federal support to help our residents through this emergency,” said Gov. Phil Murphy at a Thursday briefing. Ten other states confronting the worst coronavirus numbers — including New York, California and Washington — have also been declared major disaster areas. In Pennsylvania, the state has handed out more than 678,000 N95 masks to hospitals, health-care systems, and emergency responders, along with thousands of gloves, gowns, and goggles, Levine said, providing the first exact numbers from the commonwealth. The numbers did not include supplies hospitals and other jurisdictions already had or supplies from the federal government. “We know our hospitals will face capacity issues,” Wolf said Thursday. “We need more beds, we need more ventilators, we need more personal protective equipment, and so much more — and we need it as soon as possible, because the virus is here.” Shortages are already so pronounced that as alcohol distilleries have shifted to making hand sanitizer, the Lehigh Valley plant that manufactures the uniforms worn by Major League Baseball players was halting the production of baseball jerseys in order to start making a million masks and gowns to donate to Pennsylvania hospitals, Fanatics owner Michael Rubin said Thursday. The rush to find supplies is accompanied by a race to secure space to put patients, quarantined people, and the bodies of the dead. Officials are closely watching New York City, which has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. As Philadelphia’s confirmed cases continued to grow, reaching 475, including newly confirmed cases among city police officers, firefighters, and SEPTA workers, city officials were in “various stages of negotiations” to lease as many as six hotels to use for quarantine or isolation space, Managing Director Brian Abernathy said. The hotels, which are desirable because they already have private beds, bathrooms, and showers, would be used for people who are homeless or cannot quarantine at home because they have an immunocompromised family member, are experiencing domestic violence, or have other situations. Philadelphia is also working on plans for added hospital capacity in case of a surge in cases requiring hospitalization. The city also may set up a space for hospitals to send patients who “may be on the mend and can free up beds.” And the Glen Mills Schools campus, which closed after an Inquirer investigation exposed a pattern of abuse at the reform academy, looked set to become a federal medical center that would house regional overflow patients in a potential surge. The Army Corps of Engineers and Department of Homeland Security visited the Delaware County site earlier this week and gave a final security approval late Thursday. “Based on the observed progression of COVID-19, we expect that hospitals in our region will require significant assistance from a federal medical station,” a group of Pennsylvania members of Congress wrote to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But on Thursday, Philadelphia ended negotiations over the potential use of the former Hahnemann University Hospital facility after the owner of the site wanted about $1 million a month for the empty hospital building and did not agree to the city’s counteroffers. The shuttered hospital has no beds and “would require extensive work” to be used again, Mayor Jim Kenney said, adding, “We are done and we are moving on.” Sam Singer, a spokesperson for hospital owner Joel Freedman, said he understands the city’s stance but is ready to re-engage if the situation changes. Asked about plans to set up a morgue for coronavirus victims, Abernathy said, “We certainly are aware that New York City has brought in a number of refrigerator trucks in order to prepare” for holding bodies, “and we are taking similar precautions.” Kenney, meanwhile, encouraged Philadelphians to comply with his stay-at-home order to avoid a situation similar to New York’s. “Many of you have seen the terrifying videos of overloaded hospitals in Spain and in Italy. Now New York is facing that reality,” he said. “We don’t want Philadelphia to be the next major city in that situation.” As 3.28 million initial weekly claims for unemployment insurance were filed last week, shattering the previous record of 695,000 in a week in 1982, hundreds of thousands in Pennsylvania and New Jersey — where all nonessential businesses are under orders not to operate — were among those filing. Wolf projected that the state will have about 800,000 new unemployment insurance claims from March 15 through Friday, which would represent about 10% of all the new claims in the country. “Pennsylvania is really the epicenter of the unemployment insurance claims, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that we turn these things around as quickly as possible,” Wolf said. The Greater Philadelphia YMCA laid off most of its workforce Thursday, cutting 4,000 jobs in what appears to be the largest mass layoff yet in Pennsylvania amid the coronavirus pandemic. And low-wage worker groups called on Philadelphia to create an emergency fund of $5 million to $10 million for the tens of thousands of workers who are likely to be left out of state and federal relief efforts and an expansion of the city’s paid sick leave law because they are undocumented or working in the cash economy. To aid in the state’s economic recovery, New Jersey’s Economic Development Authority on Thursday unveiled $75 million worth of programs aimed at helping nearly 5,000 small businesses weather the crisis that has forced non-essential businesses to close. As of Thursday, 155,000 people in New Jersey had filed for unemployment, a 16-fold increase from the week before, Murphy said. Meanwhile, Philadelphia judges agreed to begin reviewing motions with the aim of reducing the jail population during the pandemic, and on Thursday, Delaware County sharply reduced the inmate population at its jail, in part by expediting plea bargains for nearly 100 inmates, the county said. With 94% of riders no longer using Regional Rail, SEPTA said it would begin an “essential service” schedule Sunday and begged customers, “If you don’t have to ride, please don’t.” And Wolf said he is considering suspending bus service by companies such as Megabus between New York and Philadelphia. Earlier this week, federal officials told anyone who has recently been in New York City to quarantine for two weeks. Wolf emphasized that Pennsylvanians need to continue to stay home for the state to have hope of stopping the rapid growth in virus cases. “We’re not fighting a battle here,"" Wolf said, “we’re fighting a war.” Contributing to this article were staff writers Rob Tornoe, Vinny Vella, Mike Newall, Chris Palmer, Jonathan Tamari, Patricia Madej, Harold Brubaker, Juliana Feliciano Reyes, Matt Breen, Anna Orso, and Jason Laughlin, as well as Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA.

219,How the coronavirus stimulus package can help retirees and savers,"The House gave final passage Friday to a massive $2.2 trillion stimulus package intended to help businesses and workers cope with the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. But goodies for Americans saving for retirement, and those already retired, are also tucked inside. “The bill is complex, so check with a tax specialist or accountant before making any big moves,” said Mitch Gerstein, a CPA with Isdaner & Co. in Bala Cynwyd. “But the idea is to put money into people’s hands as fast as possible.” Here’s what you need to know. Usually, retirees must take out a minimum lump sum every year from their retirement accounts. It’s called the required minimum distribution (RMD), and you pay taxes on that money. But this year, you don’t have to take your RMD under the stimulus law and can avoid paying taxes, too. “Some people already took money out this year,” Gerstein said. “And, yes, you can put it back. There is a provision [in existing legislation] that you can take money out of an IRA and within 60 days, you can put it back in.” The new legislation makes several changes to policy around retirement savings. You can wait to contribute money to your retirement plan. On March 24, the IRS issued rules that extended the due date for IRA contributions and plan contributions to July 15 instead of April 15. In addition, the package waives the 10% tax for withdrawals for amounts up to $100,000 from all retirement plans and IRAs. You can take out the money as a loan, not paying any taxes, on one condition: Any amount you take out must be repaid in three years. Who qualifies? According to the new law, anyone who experiences “adverse financial consequences” as a result of being quarantined, furloughed, laid off, or suffering reduced working hours, or who is unable to work due to lack of child care. That’s most of us. In addition, the bill increases the dollar amount available for loans from retirement accounts from $50,000 to $100,000, according to a client note by the law firm Steptoe & Johnson. So say you have a workplace 401(k). The CARES Act temporarily doubles the current retirement plan loan limits to $100,000 to allow individuals to borrow up to the lesser of $100,00 or 100% of their vested retirement account balance for loans made during the 180 day period starting on the date the CARES Act is enacted. The CARES ACT was enacted on March 27th . The legislation encourages Americans to contribute to charity in 2020 by relaxing some of the limitations on charitable contributions: For instance, allowing a deduction of up to $300 of cash contributions, whether or not the taxpayer itemizes deductions on their taxes. Also, the new law scraps the 50% limit on charitable deductions for individuals. The new legislation aggressively expands unemployment benefits to gig-economy workers adversely impacted by the coronavirus. Gig-economy workers can receive the same unemployment benefits as any other laid-off employees under the law — including an additional $600 a week for up to four months — even if the employee is currently making less, and an additional 13 weeks of benefits for participating states. If you’re self-employed, you don’t have to pay payroll taxes through the rest of the year. You have a year or more to pay it back, according to Gerstein.

220,"College sports will be hit hard, and will not be the same economically after the coronavirus | Mike Jensen","The NCAA announced the financial hit Thursday in a news release: After winter and spring championships had been canceled because of the coronavirus, the board of governors had “voted unanimously to distribute $225 million in June to Division I members to specifically focus on supporting college athletes.” The real news came in the second paragraph, that the distribution had been budgeted for $600 million. The NCAA had insurance for lost NCAA basketball tournament revenue, but the policy isn’t paying off dollar-for-dollar. The NCAA still hopes to pay off the rest of the distribution using a loan. However that plays out, lost tournament dollars are just the tip of the iceberg. Most cuts won’t be announced in news releases. Interviews with more than a dozen conference and school administrators and coaches led to the same conclusion: The economic climate in college sports that existed pre-coronavirus, even just a month ago, was vastly different from the one that will emerge post-coronavirus. The ramifications will be endless. Assume the facilities arms race that consumed big-time college sports for more than two decades could slow to a crawl. Athletic department budgets will be trimmed across divisions. Schools trying to stay open might question the importance of having an athletics program at all. “If you’re losing money everywhere on campus and can’t make up the difference in enrollment numbers and retention -- if you can’t do it because of the changing state of our lives right now -- there’s not a lot of promise in there for athletics,"" said Drexel sports management professor Karen Weaver, former athletic director at Penn State Abington. “As students ask for room and board refunds we are talking tens of million per school,” said one Division III athletic director. Weaver noted that demographics show there will be fewer high school students graduating over the next 10 years, so this singular event comes at an especially tough time. Experts also note that with less disposable income out there, revenue from ticket sales will suffer along with donations. In the NCAA release announcing the revenue distribution cut, it said the board of governors “stressed the importance of using the distributions to aid college athletes during the uncertainty of the current environment, along with the importance of planning carefully with less revenue.” Of the $225 million distribution, the NCAA said $50 million will come from NCAA reserves. The NCAA said it had a $270 million event cancellation insurance policy, “and the proceeds when received will be used to pay off a line of credit that will cover the remaining distribution within 12 months.” Lost conference tournament revenue also is a major issue. Do the venues demand full payment? That’s an unknown, one veteran administrator said. “I’m sure there are some outs on both sides.” Also, longtime partners might handle such issues differently, wishing to maintain the partnership. For most schools, the conference share isn’t the biggest bucket of revenue. Fund-raising, marketing and sponsorships, ticket sales, merchandising, all are buckets in addition to conference revenue. All will be affected. “Say you’re in a fund-raising campaign right now,"" said a longtime athletic director. “Very sensitive. Sponsorships come open. People might be looking at the world very differently now. Next year’s marketing budgets might take a hit.” Colleges aren’t waiting to trim budgets. Temple already announced 5% cuts across all departments. The University of Bridgeport in Connecticut, a Division II school, announced it was laying off many of its athletics staffers, including some coaches. The school said it hoped the layoffs are temporary. Moody’s, the investment rating service, this month revised its outlook of the higher-education sector from stable to negative, citing “unprecedented enrollment uncertainty” and “risks to multiple revenue streams.” It noted that more than 30% of public universities and nearly 30% of privates were already running operating deficits. Atlantic 10 commissioner Bernadette McGlade thinks the potential cost of funding another year of spring sports “will be significant.” Combined with the loss of post-season basketball revenue, all the schools will feel that hit. She also noted that loss of 2020 men’s basketball, if greatly reduced, “represents a deduction in revenue for a rolling six-year period!”  To absorb that loss, McGlade said, a conference will need to rely on its own investment reserve funds “to make up what could be a large deficit.” American Athletic Conference commissioner Mike Aresco, whose membership includes Temple, also listed the suspension or cancellation of the 2020 football season as the potential event that would have the most impact. Beyond operational revenue losses from not having a conference tournament and NCAA tournament, and the cancellation of the spring season, Aresco mentioned, “the uncertainty surrounding sponsorship revenue, donations to the schools, etc.” The NCAA said Division II will receive 4.37% of actual revenues, currently projected to be $13.9 million for the division, which is a $30 million decrease from last year. Division III will receive 3.18% of actual revenues, currently projected to be $10.7 million for the division, which is a $22 million decrease from last year. “These amounts will be used to fund national programs,"" the NCAA said in a release. In other words, there is no trickle-down to the schools themselves. In Division I, there is some trickle-down, with schools receiving shares of conference revenue from the NCAA basketball tournament profits. “For us, a million dollars, that’s huge,"" Atlantic Sun commissioner Ted Gumbart told the Associated Press. Sharing tournament revenues varies between conferences. It’s not uncommon for schools to keep a portion of NCAA revenue, units accumulated as a team advances in the NCAA Tournament, while part of that share is distributed around the league. So if Dayton, for instance, had made a deep run in the NCAA Tournament, all the Atlantic 10 schools would in time have benefited from that run. “Mid-majors will suffer most from loss to NCAA basketball tournament revenues,"" predicted Bill Bradshaw, former athletic director at La Salle, DePaul, Temple, and La Salle again. “Power 5 [schools] would be significantly impacted if football is canceled in the fall.” “For an athletic program like Drexel this could mean a reduction of revenues in the six-figure range,"" Drexel athletic director Eric Zillmer said of lost tournament revenue. “As colleges reimburse students for prorated dormitory and meal plans, there will be a substantial cost,"" said Tom Shirley, Jefferson University athletic director and women’s basketball coach, wondering about the to-be-determined trickle-down to athletic budgets. Assuming the NCAA allows spring sports athletes to come back next year, “there will be costs associated with renewing their scholarships for an extra year,"" Shirley said. “Plus squad sizes grow, as do travel and equipment costs. Meanwhile, the freshmen who thought they were going to play right away, sit behind a fifth- or sixth-year senior. Do they transfer at Christmas break?” “Smaller institutions that required rentals and fund-raised for scholarships may need to cut budgets or scholarships in an effort to stay solvent,"" said West Chester men’s basketball coach Damien Blair. With enrollment goals being challenged, impacting budgets, and the fund-raising impact as there is less disposable income, Delaware Valley athletic director Dave Duda said he thought colleges would be affected “across the board.” “The first anyone will worry about -- the number of sports opportunities will be reduced, either squad sizes or teams,"" Weaver said. “Employee levels are based on [overall] squad sizes.” Weaver added that rules have changed, allowing schools to keep making admissions offers after May 1, so more poaching will go on as everyone tries to make their numbers, which will trickle down to athletics. On a list of concerns, a Division I college administrator who didn’t want to be identified said (1) no college football; (2) no college football; (3) no college football; (4) no 2020 NCAA basketball tournament revenue stream. Maybe there’s actually a droplet of hope in that thought: If the games go on and the stadiums are open for football season, the impact at many schools will be less severe. “What football means to a university goes way beyond athletic revenue,"" said that same administrator, referring to alumni returning to campus, donations tied to such gatherings, and overall feelings toward the alma mater, as the very identity of so many Division I colleges is tied to football. “It’s more than a front porch.” Athletic directors naturally are prioritizing what concerns need most immediate attention. “I am currently focusing on the financial implications related to the potential year of eligibility for spring sports student-athletes,"" said St. Joseph’s athletic director Jill Bodensteiner, making it clear that she’s also looking at “the multiple sources of potential impact on our revenue.” Locally, you can find-small college coaches who are privately worried their full-time job will be made part-time, with benefits cut. A contractor who films games and practices for local schools already found his work and income dried up, with no way to make up the money. Bradshaw also pointed out that schools with low endowments, whose overall budgets are tuition-driven, will be further affected, “and may have to drop sports, drop athletics, or close its doors.” Non-revenue male sports could be most impacted, Bradshaw said, because Division I football, Division I basketball, and women’s sports will be the highest priorities, “in that order.” “Colleges will close, drop athletics entirely or cut considerably the number of sports they offer,"" said Joe Giunta, former athletic director at Cabrini and Dickinson and former associate athletic director at Temple. To be clear, these people weren’t asked about their worst fears for the economic impact, only what they thought the largest economic impacts would be. Tuition-driven institutions might take the biggest hit, said Wilmington University basketball coach Dan Burke. “Many families will hit tough times,” meaning, he said, that high school seniors without  scholarship offers might choose to go to junior college instead of the Division III non-scholarship route right away. There is a consensus on the areas that will be hit across the landscape. Rowan athletic director John Giannini, the former La Salle basketball coach, listed the loss of NCAA basketball revenue along with campus-wide cutbacks on university allocations because of budget strains, and loss of corporate sponsorships for canceled events. Big East associate commissioner Vince Nicastro had a similar list, starting with the NCAA Tournament lost revenue. “Those revenues are crucial, particularly for conferences that rely on that money to fund basic operations,” he said. Villanova athletic director Mark Jackson listed conference tournament revenue even ahead of NCAA Tournament revenue and corporate-partnership support as being most impactful on the whole landscape. With student fees going toward operating budgets at many schools, “the debt service has been predicated on having a consistent level of student fees,"" said Weaver, the Drexel sports management professor. “That is one of the [lenses] you have to look at this through.” So, for instance, Temple might be very lucky that the school didn’t move on building an on-campus football stadium. “Oh, my gosh,"" Weaver said of that potential scenario. Going farther back, Villanova also might have been lucky when it looked at moving up to the top division of college football but ultimately wasn’t invited to join Big East football before the league splintered. “Depending on how long it lasts, the big-time programs may face the prospects of paying for bloated athletic budgets [including athletic administration] with depressed revenues,"" said Villanova sociology professor Rick Eckstein, who has written books on how sports stadiums have been funded with public dollars, and the impact of college athletics on girls sports. “I’m not sure this is purely economic, but with the youth sport pipelines all but shut down, it’s going to be harder [and possibly more expensive] for schools to recruit in the traditional manner,” Eckstein said, adding that the traditional manner is often “pay to play.” This might not affect big-time football and men’s basketball as much, Eckstein said. “But it will affect most of the other sports at every divisional level.” Let’s not call these ripple effects. More like an undertow, with the endless impacts of this pandemic ripping back to an athletic shoreline that is irrevocably changed.

221,"Coronavirus layoffs in the Philly region are hitting hotel, restaurant, and nonprofit workers hard: ‘It’s total annihilation’","Big employers in the Philadelphia region have announced more than 15 times as many layoffs so far this month than in all of March last year, a microcosm of the massive job losses that the coronavirus pandemic has visited upon the state and the nation. At least 4,114 layoffs have been announced by major employers since March 1 in Philadelphia and its surrounding Southeastern Pennsylvania counties, according to notices published by the state Department of Labor and Industry. In March 2019, there were 270 layoffs announced by such businesses with more than 100 full-time workers, which are required to disclose plans to let workers go under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN. Those numbers likely offer just a glimpse of the total number of job losses in the region, because they capture staffing cuts by only the larger companies that have to file reports, said Jonathan Krause, a lawyer at Philadelphia law firm Klehr Harrison Harvey Branzburg who specializes in labor and employment law. “A lot of people have been hurt by this,” said Gene Barr, president and chief executive of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. ""It has been massive.” The regional layoffs track an unprecedented rise in new unemployment claims nationally, which surged to 3.3 million claims for last week, the highest number since data have been collected. The number far surpassed a 1982 record of 695,000 claims in a single week set during a recession. In Pennsylvania alone, there were about 645,000 new claims for unemployment compensation in the days after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered a statewide shutdown to slow the coronavirus.  New Jersey’s Department of Labor and Workforce Development, meanwhile, received 155,815 new claims for unemployment insurance for the week ending March 21, a 1,546% increase over the prior week. Pennsylvania’s unemployment claims were the highest in the nation, with New Jersey coming in fourth, according to a tally by NJ.com. Other figures, though, show that claims were surging in New York, California and other states. Layoffs are happening across the country, but they are ""heavily concentrated” in states where governors have issued shutdown orders, said Joel Naroff, president of the advisory firm Naroff Economics in Holland, Pa. In Pennsylvania, he said, “we hit an initial surge because, essentially, the governor didn’t mess around.” In the region’s largest mass layoff of the coronavirus crisis, the Greater Philadelphia YMCA cut 4,000 jobs, accounting for most of its workforce. Just 61 employees remain across the 16 branches and 12 early-learning centers in the region, and all have taken pay cuts, said president and chief executive Shaun Elliott. His pay was cut entirely, and pay for his direct reports was cut in half. Of the 4,000 laid-off employees, about 3,400 were in Pennsylvania, according to the group’s WARN notice. Elliot said the others had been based in South Jersey. About 700 were full-time, he said. Since 90% of the nonprofit’s income comes from membership and child-care fees, revenue dropped “precipitously” when gyms and day-care centers were required to close to slow the spread of the virus, Elliott said. “We had to make this really tough choice,” he said, “so that we could survive as an organization to reopen when it’s possible.” Another big source of job losses was the closure of the private membership Fitler Club in the Aramark headquarters building at 2400 Market St., which laid off 238 workers. The club combines dining, overnight accommodations, and co-working space — all of them hard-hit sectors — under one roof. As an industry, food-and-beverage businesses lost the greatest number of workers, after the nonprofit YMCA’s losses. Eating and drinking establishments in the region let go of 372 workers in March, when they were forced to shutter their dining rooms. The Cameron Mitchell Restaurants group said it was laying off 90 workers at its Ocean Prime steakhouse at 15th and Sansom Streets, while Middle Eastern quick-service chain Naya at 16th and Market Streets reported 11 layoffs. An unspecified number comprising “all restaurant staff” were also being let go at Aqimero in the Ritz-Carlton hotel just south of City Hall. “It’s total annihilation,” said Casey Parker, co-owner of three Philadelphia restaurants, including Jose Pistolas in Center City. Parker let go of 39 of his 44 employees, but did not have to report those layoffs to the state. “I lost 90% of my business overnight.” Also hard hit were businesses at Philadelphia International Airport, with the pandemic slowing air travel to a crawl. OTG Management, one of two companies on the WARN list operating restaurants at the airport, reported that 260 workers have been impacted by closures. The company runs 13 restaurants at the airport, including Cibo Bistro and Wine Bar, as well as Independence Prime in Terminal B. The other company that filed notice, Hojeij Branded Foods, is owned by Paradies Lagardère, which operates a Chick-fil-A and the wine bar Vino Volo. The notice didn’t specify how many workers are affected by its closure. The airport had previously announced that its 170-plus restaurants and shops would “right-size” as a result of the coronavirus, “to accommodate adjusted passenger volume levels.” Philadelphia hoteliers, meanwhile, reported 91 layoffs with the state. The largest number was let go at the Warwick Rittenhouse Square Hotel, which laid off 53. The Hilton Garden Inn at 1100 Arch St., the Logan Philadelphia on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, and the Westin Philadelphia in Center City’s Liberty Place high-rise complex have all stopped taking reservations for the coming weeks. “Some hotels have suspended operations, others are staying open with a skeleton staff,” said Ed Grose, executive director of the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association. “But pretty much every hotel has laid off a lot of people.” Grose’s group has been raising money for grocery-store gift cards for laid-off hotel employees from supporters including the Visit Philadelphia tourism-promotion agency and the Philadelphia Convention & Visitors Bureau. Since Monday, $445,000 has been raised, but the hotel group doesn’t yet have a count of how many jobless workers the money will have to be divided among. “It’s pretty sad what’s happening out there,” Grose said. -Staff writer Sam Wood contributed to this article ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,LSMEJJQWYZARLFGXQ4L4DVSXPA
222,"Philly City Council adds $400,000 to spend as it chooses in $85 million coronavirus response measure","Philadelphia City Council members on Thursday took steps to approve Mayor Jim Kenney’s request for $85 million to respond to the coronavirus crisis, but only after adding a late provision that would give them $400,000 to spend as they see fit. Tacked on as an amendment to the emergency spending bill, Council approved the provision in a closed meeting, its first since the pandemic shut down the city government. The city’s coronavirus response has so far been handled by the executive branch, but Council President Darrell L. Clarke told reporters after the meeting that the $400,000 was necessary to “get the word out about this coronavirus” and encourage residents to practice social distancing. As of Thursday, Philadelphia had reported 475 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 40 patients hospitalized and one death. “Council will be using a series of different initiatives to ensure we get information out to individuals, using social media, using public service announcements,” Clarke said. Council members ""all have their niches in terms of their ability to get the word out. You are going to see a very aggressive social media campaign, one like you probably have never seen before.” On the same conference call, Councilmember Maria Quiñones-Sánchez said residents may be more likely to heed the guidance from the city — such as limiting contact and intermingling — if the messaging comes directly from their representatives on Council. “I can tell you that in districts like mine, people are not listening,"" she said. ""We’ve had situations at parks, people hanging out in front of houses.” In a memorandum sent to Council members, Clarke’s office said the $400,000 would be used for mailings with details about testing locations, unemployment benefits, meal pickup locations offered by the School District, and other information. Council also asked to have updates every two weeks on the city’s spending in response to the pandemic. Kenney said Thursday that he was OK with Council spending money to share information because the city needs to get “as much information as possible out there."" He also called “appropriate” its request to monitor spending. Managing Director Brian Abernathy said the $85 million could be used to secure facilities for quarantine space, or to buy protective gear, medical equipment, or vehicles needed to respond to the pandemic. The funds will be redirected from unspent money in the budget to Abernathy’s office, which oversees operational departments, although Abernathy said it was difficult to predict how exactly the money will be spent. “I can’t tell you today that I’m not going to need something different tomorrow, because that is likely to happen,"" he said at a news conference Thursday. “I need to have the flexibility to respond to the crisis in real time.” In a written explanation to Council members, the administration did project some likely expenses: $3 million for N95 masks; $2 million for IT needs; $2 million in relief for small businesses; and $500,000 to help nonprofits through the PHL COVID-19 Fund established last week. The city also estimated that it would spend an additional $20 million per pay period in salaries and benefits during the pandemic; essential workers are being paid 50% more than their base salary.  Local businesses have already submitted grant or loan applications for more than $10 million from the city, Sánchez said. Councilmember Cherelle L. Parker said 1,093 of the 1,760 requests for aid were from businesses with annual profits below $500,000 that would qualify for “micro-loans.” Lawmakers plan to return to work next week to give the spending bill final approval. Clarke said technology would likely be in place to hold that meeting remotely. Despite meeting in person as usual on Thursday, Council took steps to enforce social distancing practices, including preventing members of the public or media from joining lawmakers in Council chambers. At least one member was wearing gloves during the meeting. Public comment was collected online prior to Thursday’s meetings. Although members of the public could watch the meeting on TV or online, Council members did not explain the amendment adding $400,000 for their own use as they approved it. Clarke later acknowledged that the process may have lacked transparency. “We were trying to move this process as expeditiously as possible, so that could have potentially been an oversight,” he said. “A little different times for us, and every now and then we don’t necessarily get it completely right.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,PGZIN6P3ZBB7JIYCPW6A7HCHOQ
223,Will coronavirus kill off the news business just when America realized we actually need it? | Will Bunch,"Even the late great Charles Dickens, who churned out copy for 19th-century daily London rags like the Morning Chronicle before he went super long-form, would have struggled to keep up with the best of times and worst of times hitting America’s (and the world’s) newsrooms in the earth-shattering year of 2020. On the upside, the public’s craving for accurate, real-time information about the coronavirus — what’s open or closed, how to stay safe, or how quickly is the global pandemic spreading — has sent internet traffic to news websites skyrocketing to once unthinkable levels. After several years when the New York Times was becoming Home Depot with its digital subscriptions while local papers were becoming your dying Main Street hardware store, people now desperately need news about their home town. Many local sites say online readership has more than doubled. What could go wrong? A lot. Even as most newsrooms push for a new business model around digital subscriptions, the old model — heavily dependent on advertising — had helped keep U.S. journalism barely afloat...until now. With nearly half the nation on near-total lockdown and the rest reeling, most of the businesses that buy ads in local papers, especially in smaller towns or for youth-oriented alt-weeklies — like restaurants, nightclubs or boutiques — are closed and have nothing to advertise. Scores of layoffs are already happening. Consider New Orleans. I’ve written in the past about the struggle of journalism to survive near the mouth of the Mighty Mississippi, where a perfect storm of lots of news (from climate change in our lowest-lying state and a swatch of chemical plants called “Cancer Alley” to a tradition of crooked government) and poverty — with fewer folks than average having digital access — had roiled the market. But with the city, on a per capita basis, now rivaling New York as a coronavirus epicenter, things have really hit the fan. This week, the Advocate, the news org that survived to cover much of southern Louisiana, said that, with ad revenue vanishing rapidly, it would furlough a tenth of its workforce and the rest would work just four days a week. That’s happening as Louisiana’s hospitals and, increasingly, its morgues are overwhelmed with new cases. “This is a story that is moving and changing and if you take a three-day break, you’re going to miss a bunch,” an anonymous Advocate staffer complained to the Washington Post’s Erik Wemple of the shortened workweek. Yet some journalists might envy the New Orleans scribes — having lost their jobs entirely or, in a couple cases, seen their publications shut down. Some venerable alt-weeklies like St Louis’ award-winning Riverfront Times are already shells of their recent selves. The virus is proving an insidious weapon against any business model for modern newsrooms. Even the huge increase in web traffic has been somewhat negated by some advertisers demanding their digital ads not run next to stories about coronavirus, even though there’s little other news. Most newsrooms have seen upticks in digital subscribers — even after many news orgs moved coronavirus stories in front of the paywall that’s meant to drive subscriptions — but so far it’s not enough to offset the ad-loss tsunami. This has all been a plot twist in the wider war for the future of journalism that escalated when President Trump was elected on a media-bashing platform in 2016. But even as the 45th POTUS attacked “fake news” and called journalists “enemies of the people,"" while news orgs like the Post argued back that “democracy dies in darkness,” to many everyday readers this was often an abstract kind of cold war. Not anymore. The coronavirus has made it clear that access to accurate information can be a matter of life and death. That’s particularly true because Trump has increasingly tried to dominate the flow of information about the coronavirus, through lengthy, televised briefings every afternoon, as well as added events like Tuesday’s town hall on Fox News and the president’s pesky Twitter feed. But sometimes Trump’s “facts” are flat-out wrong, and much of the rest can be self-serving propaganda. Rigorous independent journalists are the only real fact check. Yet already our deeply divided nation can’t agree on a common set of facts about the coronavirus and how to prevent it. A CBS News/YouGov poll released this week revealed among Democrats, a healthy 72% trust the national media for information on the coronavirus — not far behind the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the respondent’s governor — while Trump rated just 14%. Yet among Republicans, a whopping 90% trust Trump and only 13% believed the national media. In a time of creeping authoritarianism, the economic collapse of much of the news media will make this problem worse. And many of the smaller towns where Trumpism is already entrenched will lose any reality-based counter-balance. That’s on top of the general erosion of civic life and connectedness these communities will feel without local media. What is to be done? The formula that many news orgs have been refining to stay afloat in the 2020s — in part because of ad dollars that were already disappearing before the pandemic — will struggle to keep up. The uptick in digital subscriptions — the core of that survival strategy — could become a downtick if the recession lingers. Sponsored events, another new tool, can’t take place in cities that are on lockdown. Big time philanthropy — which has been the saving grace for the Inquirer after its 2016 donation to the non-profit Lenfest Institute — may be similar challenged, or at least distracted, by the challenge of coronavirus. That brings us to the bailer-outer of last resort: Washington. The idea of government support for journalism has long been a non-starter for folks in the business, myself included, for an obvious reason: the fear that any taxpayer dollars, doled out through the good graces of politicians, might — even subconsciously — cause journalists to pull their punches when writing about those pols. And that was a concern long before the bill-signer at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was a thin-skinned shouter of “fake news.” But the bizarre dichotomy of the current crisis — journalism that’s vital to cover a virus that’s eating away what little is left of the business model — has, at least in my opinion, dramatically changed the moral calculus. This week, Craig Aaron, CEO of the media advocacy group Free Press, wrote a much-discussed piece in Columbia Journalism Review arguing that “Journalism needs a stimulus” via Congress, to the tune of $5 billion. Aaron argued in the piece that the money — a fraction of the more than $2.5 trillion the feds have pumped into coronavirus relief packages so far — could increase funding for public radio and TV in underserved areas, support local newsroom jobs for the duration of the health crisis and related slowdown, and support innovative news-gathering projects. This agenda could be supported going forward by a small tax on the kind of targeted digital ads that made Google and Facebook wealthy while decimating local news. “The last weeks have driven home how important it is to have local reporters telling what’s going on,” Aaron told me by phone Wednesday. “People are desperate for trustworthy information.” He acknowledged that the idea of government relief funds for journalism may have been unthinkable before the crisis — but so was the $2-trillion-plus package now in the pipeline. (Aaron notes the final bill has $75 million for public media and small-business support that could go to private newsrooms, but he said any grand journalism stimulus would have to come in the next package, which seems certain as the crisis persists.) Aaron also argued that the success of investigative journalism by the public-funded PBS Frontline or efforts in other countries (most notably the BBC) should quell ethical worries, especially if journalism stimulus grants were administered by an independent board, as removed as possible from politicians’ control. It’s a convincing argument. This longtime skeptic is on board, if it can be done in this right fashion. Until then, I’d urge those who are still collecting a paycheck, and loading up on news about where to buy milk or whether a loved one needs a COVID-19 test, to consider subscribing to your local hometown newspaper and not just the two or three national brands. (If you live in greater Philly, the Inquirer link is here.) But we’ll likely need even more. The coronavirus crisis has revealed America’s badly frayed safety net, from underfunded rural hospitals to underpaid workers in the food supply chain. Journalists providing accurate, real-time information are a critical part of that web. America shouldn’t try to find out if we can live without it.

224,Peeps cease production two weeks before Easter due to the coronavirus,"Two weeks before Easter, the production lines for Peeps have stopped due to the coronavirus outbreak. But don’t expect a shortage on store shelves if you’re looking to celebrate the holiday at home. A hefty supply of the popular marshmallow candies has already shipped to retailers from their factories in Bethlehem and Philadelphia, according to Just Born, the family-owned confectionery company that makes Peeps, as well as Mike and Ike, Hot Tamales, Teenee Beanee jelly beans, and Goldenberg’s Peanut Chews. Just Born suspended production on Wednesday and will do so at least through April 7, the company said in a statement. The news is the latest indicator that the coronavirus, and measures to slow its spread, will continue to disrupt the normal way of life through the April 12 Easter holiday, and likely even longer. This is in sharp contrast to the words of President Donald Trump, who says he wants to see the country “raring to go” by Easter, with churches packed. Health experts say that could be a disastrous idea. In Philadelphia at least, churches will be empty. Earlier this week, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia canceled all public Masses and services for Holy Week and Easter, a move that will affect the region’s 1.3 million Catholics and the more than 250 parishes at which they worship. For many, Easter also means family gatherings, egg hunts, and baskets full of candy. For 67 years, Peeps has been a part of that tradition. A Bethlehem city proclamation last year called the candy “an iconic symbol of Easter.” Just Born makes about 5.5 million Peeps a day. Despite the temporary suspension in production, the company said it would continue to pay employees, who are working remotely.

225,Hospitals already face financial ruin. Coronavirus makes it worse. | Expert Opinion,"Philadelphia is intimately familiar with the detrimental effects of hospital closures following the recent shutdown of Hahnemann University Hospital. As the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies, hospitals throughout the country, including Philadelphia’s, are staring down a financial crisis. The costs of hospital preparation, patient care, and contingency planning are beginning to add up. Like our patients, hospitals are not immune to the effects of this crisis. The American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Nurses Association have lobbied Congress for an aid package of $100 billion, which looks like it will go through in the national stimulus deal. It is urgently necessary. Even successful hospitals have low operating margins, and many hospitals were on the brink of financial collapse even before this pandemic hit. Rural hospitals, in particular, were entering bankruptcy with alarming frequency. With health care representing one-sixth of the U.S. GDP, losing more hospitals would have wide-ranging effects throughout the whole economy, not to mention public health. Hahnemann’s closure led to large-scale disruption in the health care delivery system and economy of Philadelphia: Over 2,000 jobs were lost, including about 40% of clinical employees. Over 500 residents and fellows were displaced, forced to complete training elsewhere. The job losses affected businesses that directly depend on, or support, the hospital ecosystem. The loss of safety-net hospitals disproportionately affects the health needs of those in society with the fewest resources. Out of 44 acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania, only 29 were profitable in 2018. Of the profitable hospitals, only the top six had net incomes greater than $50 million. Despite the apparent density of hospitals in Philadelphia, much of the city’s population lives in areas with high needs and disparities in access. Among the 47 zip codes in Philadelphia County, 35 fall within the top two highest quintiles for need, according to the Community Needs Index, a measure of barriers to care. Losing Hahnemann severely disrupted access to care for these vulnerable populations. The possibility of additional hospital closures in Philadelphia or the surrounding rural areas poses a grave threat to our communities, both during the pandemic and in its aftermath as we refocus on subacute and chronic care needs. Hospitals within Pennsylvania and across the country face a significant financial burden that preceded, and will outlive, their emergency COVID-19 response. Many care-related costs are not reimbursable under current payment mechanisms, legislation so far has not covered preparatory expenses, and there is significant lost revenue from canceled elective outpatient procedures and appointments. Nationally, outpatient services account for $472 billion dollars in annual net revenue, or $1.85 billion dollars per day of operation. Some regions like New York, California, and Washington State are already suspending outpatient operations to maximize capacity for COVID-19 patients. These service suspensions will save lives, but they will come at great cost to our hospitals. Pennsylvania and other states will undoubtedly experience their own surges in the coming weeks. Based on disease modeling simulations, patient surges above the capacity of baseline ICU care could be expected to last eight to 14 weeks; loss of outpatient revenue for this long could total $130 billion. Hospitals may need up to 7.3 billion respirator masks at a cost of approximately $11.4 billion. Insufficient protection means higher staffing costs to replace infected or quarantined workers. Stand-up testing centers operating nationwide screenings will cost millions of dollars per day. Additional costs include hospital floor reconfigurations, extra ventilator procurement, mobile treatment and quarantine facilities, telehealth upgrades, laboratory expansions, enhanced sanitation procedures, and staff/community education. This pandemic response will require coordinated, proactive, and expensive preparation by hospitals. Congressional action is key to provide hospitals with the reassurance that patient-focused planning can continue without concern for financial solvency. Hospitals will need more than $100 billion to cover lost revenue. Loans can also be provided to satisfy shorter-term payroll obligations and ensure the liquidity necessary to prepare. Additional legislative options to quickly free up extra dollars include suspending upcoming statutory Medicare and Medicaid payment cuts. State and local governments can do their part by exploring the conversion of empty dormitories, conference centers, or hotels to quarantine or care facilities for nearby hospitals. Recent history has demonstrated the devastating effects that hospital closures can have on their surrounding communities, especially here in Philadelphia. It is incumbent on our leaders in Washington to provide the fiscal support necessary for hospitals to survive this crisis. The future cost of delays in funding, both in lives and hospitals lost, could dwarf the aid needed today.

A survey of 23 health systems around Pennsylvania revealed that more than half, including Einstein Medical Center and Temple University Hospital systems, required nurses and technicians to use their own time for quarantine. “If I do come back now and I get sick, I have no time accrued,” an eight-year nursing veteran said. Other workers are also demanding more protection. Several people have also tested positive for COVID-19 at one Philadelphia nursing home, while another nursing-home case was reported in Northampton County, leading leading long-term care workers to demand more protection. These health workers who care for seniors and people with disabilities called on the state for more masks, hand sanitizer, and paid time off, my colleague at Spotlight PA Cynthia Fernandez reported. “No group of people are at higher risk than older adults,"" representatives from two industry organizations said, “and no group of organizations will be asked to support them through both prevention and mitigation more than nursing homes and long-term care providers.” 🐶How much does that doggie in the window want a walk?

227,Coronavirus is already having a ‘stunning’ impact on unemployment in Pennsylvania,"The economic bleeding from the coronavirus pandemic is already well underway in Pennsylvania. And it’s going to get worse before it gets better. More than a whopping half a million Pennsylvanians have filed new unemployment claims during the last week, according to a state senator briefed by the Department of Labor and Industry. The 540,000 new unemployment claims — filed between March 16, when Gov. Tom Wolf first announced the closure of all nonessential businesses, and Tuesday — are a record number, and demonstrate the sweeping economic fallout from efforts to slow the coronavirus. Many of those who filed are low-wage workers. They are hotel housekeepers, baggage handlers, cashiers — workers already in precarious positions, facing unpredictable schedules, unaffordable health care, and no access to paid sick leave. And then there are workers who aren’t even reflected in the department’s count because they aren’t eligible for unemployment insurance: undocumented workers, gig workers, and workers who get paid in cash. “It’s a stunning number,” said Rob Wonderling, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia. Previously, the highest number of first-time claims filed in a week in Pennsylvania since at least 1987 was 61,181, in early 2010, according to federal labor statistics. The monthly total that year also set the previous record, topping out at 168,159. The job losses from the coronavirus will far exceed those numbers. “You are going to have more and more people laid off,” said State Sen. Christine Tartaglione (D., Philadelphia), the minority chair of the Senate committee on labor and industry. “There are going to be a lot more.” The Department of Labor and Industry declined to comment ahead of its expected release of official numbers Thursday. That data will cover Monday through Friday of last week, so it will differ from the 540,000 figure, which included the beginning of this week. Roughly 50,000 to 90,000 claims have been filed each day since Wolf ordered nonessential businesses to shut down last week. Lawmakers said the flood of unemployment claims is expected to continue as more counties implement stay-at-home measures. The fallout continued Wednesday, with 14 employers notifying the state of layoffs, far more than usual. Most were hotels, but they also included movie theaters, trucking terminals, and the swanky new Fitler Club in Center City. “Even this week’s number won’t be as bad as next week’s,” said Diane Lim, an economist and senior adviser for the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Labor leaders have been fighting to get their laid-off workers included in relief efforts, while business leaders are trying to navigate the line between protecting public health and keeping the state’s economy afloat. All agree they’ve never seen such an economic collapse — not during the Great Recession, not after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Sweet compared it to a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina — but on a much larger scale. “The U.S. economy doesn’t turn on a dime,” said Ryan Sweet, director of Realtime Economics at Moody’s Analytics. “It did this time. It’s a complete stoppage.” The hardest-hit industries, he said, include leisure, hospitality, tourism, and transportation. “The sheer sudden stop in many parts of the country is something I’ve never seen before,” Sweet said. There were 1,127 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Pennsylvania as of Wednesday afternoon, compared with 153 just one week ago; 11 people had died. One of the only economic hopes Wednesday was that the state may have taken strict measures early enough to minimize the spread of the virus and eventually rebound. “All the states that have initiated shutdowns will be in a similar boat,”  said Tom Jackson, a Philadelphia-based regional economist at IHS Markit, an international business consulting firm headquartered in London. “The good thing for Pennsylvania, looking forward, if you keep the number of cases low, that can help get you back to work a little quicker and get you feeling confident that the shutdown worked and people feel safe.” Lim noted that Pennsylvania has about 7% of its workforce employed in the leisure and hospitality sectors, compared to about 21% in Nevada. “Pennsylvania is in pretty good shape compared to other states,” she said. (On the other hand, almost half of Philadelphia’s workforce is made up of low-wage service workers, many of whom work in the retail and hospitality industry.) And congressional leaders were finalizing a deal late Wednesday on a $2 trillion rescue package that would include direct payments to individuals and families, money for state governments and hospitals grappling with soaring caseloads, and aid to keep businesses afloat while most economic activity is frozen. Pennsylvania could receive about $5 billion in aid from the bill, U.S. Senator Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said Wednesday. Gene Barr, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce, said he was working to figure out how to “balance health effects and economic effects.” He believes many businesses can practice social distancing while staying open, including those in the building industry. “My concern is that if those jobs go away, they might never come back,” he said. Gabe Morgan, vice president of 32BJ SEIU, said he was relieved to see money set aside in the congressional rescue package for airline subcontractors, whom his union represents nationwide. His union, as well as mayors from across the country including Mayor Jim Kenney, had urged Congress to include subcontractors in any airline industry relief package. In Philadelphia, hundreds of airline subcontractors — baggage handlers, wheelchair attendants, and cabin cleaners — have already been laid off. “If you think about it from a city level, half the workers at airports are contracted workers,” Morgan said. “You don’t want to ignore half the jobs.” The Philadelphia Inquirer is one of more than 20 news organizations producing Broke in Philly, a collaborative reporting project on solutions to poverty and the city’s push toward economic justice.

228,"As grocery deliveries surge due to the coronavirus, the most vulnerable have to wait","If Shannon Locher had to walk into a grocery store right now, she might have a panic attack. The 33-year-old Newtown Square woman has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that limits lung function. A few months ago, her doctor was about to put her on the list for a double lung transplant, Locher said, but then a new treatment improved her lung function to 40%. Now she’s worried about the coronavirus, which can lead to severe respiratory problems. “I’m in the position where I really cannot get this,” she said. She last went to the grocery store more than two weeks ago, she said, and has since used online grocery shopping for herself, her husband, and her two young children. But it’s become increasingly difficult, she said, as delivery time slots are being reserved weeks in advance and stores’ stock fluctuates. In a normal time, when a global pandemic isn’t turning life upside down, only about 3% of grocery spending is done online. People often want to pick out their own produce and meats, and don’t find the in-person shopping process too taxing. But now, people are anxious about any human interaction. As the coronavirus outbreak intensifies, hundreds of millions of Americans have been told to stay home. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf described his order this way to residents of Philadelphia and its suburbs: “Don’t leave your home unless someone’s life depends on your leaving. Because ultimately, someone’s life does depend on you staying home."" Already at a greater risk of developing lung infections, Locher is one of the many people whose lives depend on social distancing. Under stay-at-home orders, residents are allowed to pick up groceries, take-out food, and other essentials. Experts say healthy people are generally safe to go to the grocery store as long as they take precautions and keep a safe distance from others. But seniors and those with underlying health conditions have more reason to worry about exposure to the coronavirus, since they have a higher chance of being hospitalized or suffering complications if they get sick. Contactless grocery and restaurant delivery is a safer alternative to in-person shopping, experts say, since food itself is unlikely to be a vector, even if prepared by someone who has the virus. Grocery delivery services are trying their best to meet the new demand while taking safety precautions. But it’s been a struggle. Customers who try to order from Peapod, which runs Giant’s delivery service, are greeted with a service update notifying them that delivery and pickup time slots are “extremely limited” due to “unprecedented demand,"" and product availability is limited. On Friday morning, all time slots were reserved through April 8. The website of FreshDirect, a New York-based grocer, says it’s experiencing “very high demand."" In the Philadelphia area, all delivery time slots were booked for the next week. Last week, a FreshDirect warehouse employee, who was not involved in food preparation or delivery, tested positive for the coronavirus. Amazon, which owns Whole Foods and runs its delivery service, is also seeing backups. “We’ve seen an increase in people shopping online, and are working with suppliers and distributors to ensure we’re getting products customers need,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""We are also hiring over 100,000 positions across the U.S., including for grocery delivery, enabling us to add delivery windows and get grocery orders to customers quickly.” Senior citizens find themselves in a bind, too. One home health-care worker said his senior clients can’t get essential items, including groceries and personal products, delivered. At the same time, he said, they worry about caregivers or relatives making an extra trip to a store, just one more place they could contract the virus. On Friday, Locher’s husband, Tom, picked up an order from Giant. Given the delivery backup, it was their only option to restock quickly. He went alone in his truck, she said, so packages could be placed in the bed without human interaction. They wipe down all their groceries, she said, and don’t buy any produce or other items they can’t sanitize from the outside. As Locher explained the unloading process, she paused. “It sounds so crazy. It sounds insane,” she said. “But we have to do this.” Despite all this stress around something as mundane as grocery shopping, Locher said she doesn’t resent healthy people for turning to online services, too. “I know everybody is doing the best they can,” she said. “Everybody is nervous and scared about this.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,RCNHS75QBJELTOIFWHSA634HRY
229,"As the coronavirus spreads, staving off hunger is a challenge in Kensington, Philadelphia’s poorest neighborhood","As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. Every afternoon, the line for food stretches far down Kensington Avenue. Hungry people stand wedged between the train trestles, as staffers remind them to stay at least an arm’s length away from each other. One by one, they walk through the empty yard at St. Francis Inn and up to the window. There’s no more socializing in the yard, no meals eaten in community. Just the line, and a quick exit. But the crowds still line up at St. Francis, Kensington’s main soup kitchen, for the roast beef and pasta salad and the beef and vegetable soup — because they worry that the soup kitchen may be one of the only places they can get a meal. The fear and anxiety that has gripped the whole city amid the coronavirus outbreak is only heightened for its most vulnerable residents. “When people come up to get their meals today, they are really concerned if we will be there tomorrow,” said Kaitlin Slack, a St. Francis staff member. Coronavirus-related closures mean that accessing food in Kensington, one of the city’s most impoverished neighborhoods and the epicenter of Philadelphia’s opioid epidemic, is more difficult. “We have an opioid epidemic and a pandemic on top of it,” said Eva Gladstein, the city’s deputy managing director of health and human services. Kensington is a neighborhood where getting food, for many, depends in normal times on a cobbled-together social safety net. There’s the soup kitchen, storefront churches, and Prevention Point, the public-health organization for people in addiction. Those are bolstered by restaurants that leave out excess food; church groups that bring brown-bag sandwiches and hot food on the weekends; and a host of volunteers from all over. With more people staying home to avoid spreading the virus, or becoming sick themselves, that net is starting to fray. The city has pledged to offer more resources in the coming weeks to keep it from shredding further. St. Francis has cut back to serving one meal a day instead of two. Prevention Point has stopped regularly handing out “grab-and-go” sandwiches and snacks because it doesn’t have enough protective equipment to keep volunteers safe, instead making them only when they have enough food and volunteers to pack bags. On top of this, providers worry that critical information about how to keep safe isn’t reaching their guests, some of the Philadelphians who need it most — vulnerable, hungry, and impoverished people. Many people in St. Francis’ client base get their information from libraries and drop-in centers, most now closed to slow the spread of the virus. Without more information, clients have been anxious over the new rules around social distancing, and dismayed that one of their few sources of community is trying to keep them at arm’s length, even if it’s for their own protection. “People come here for the community. They’re missing that community life,” said Slack. “There’s no place for anyone to sit and exist at this point.” Gladstein said the city is working to keep homeless residents as healthy as possible in these difficult times, both in Kensington and in Center City, where the most concentrated homeless populations reside. There are fewer volunteers, and bare-bones staff at many food programs. Even people who panhandle for food are feeling the crunch: They hold out cups on silent corners. Outreach workers have been handing out information cards on the virus for the last two weeks. The city is also installing more hand-washing stations in Kensington for people on the street. And, Gladstein said, the city is working to bolster feeding programs, reaching out to faith groups to help increase their food donations and making sure they have enough volunteers to support a regular schedule of food handouts. Those measures could be in place as early as next week, she said. They’re also trying to keep volunteers and staffers safe. Guidelines issued for food programs recommend that no indoor meals be served, and that “grab-and-go” meals be used to ensure social distancing. “Everyone, like the rest of the world, is stretched for volunteers, but I think everyone's doing their best in a bad situation,” she said. St. Francis’ freezer is a stockpile of food that could last a month, even if donations falter. Acme Markets’ meat donations, for example, are down, but the grocery chain makes up for it with packaged food. The staff is trying to get more supplies through an Amazon wish list, asking for prepackaged food and drinks, which are more sanitary. “Every day, there’s a new precaution,” Slack said. Crowds at the inn have spiked from about 250 per meal to more than 300, likely because of other closures in the neighborhood, Slack said, but the kitchen has sent home its older staffers and volunteers, leaving just eight employees to run operations. The 80 people who stay in Prevention Point’s shelters on Kensington Avenue are still getting hot meals, said Jose Benitez, the organization’s executive director. But the organization, which used to provide grab-and-go meals five days a week, now makes them only when it can spare the staff and volunteers — and the equipment to keep them safe.     “It sounds simple, to just say let’s get volunteers together and they can do it,” he said. ""But we really have to protect those folks, and we don’t have enough protective equipment to be able to supply everybody.” Some of the organization’s most crucial outreach efforts, like a needle exchange, are still operating outside the building. But Prevention Point’s drop-in center, where people in addiction can rest and receive services during the day, has been closed since March 16. The staff has been handing out a guide for clients, telling them where to find emergency meals on days Prevention Point cannot distribute food. The organization also has an Amazon wish list for donations. The Mother of Mercy House on Allegheny Avenue is still offering weekly meals, also switching to packed food instead of sit-down lunches. Staffers at all three organizations said they were determined to help guests in whatever capacity they can as the virus spreads. “The only time we would go anywhere is if someone here catches the virus or forces beyond our control shut us down,” Slack said. “We just don’t know.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:45 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,EGTBPDFH5BHRXM6TM4JHXNCOGY
230,Philadelphia reports first known coronavirus death,"Philadelphia reported its first death due to the coronavirus Wednesday, as city officials noted a continued rise in the number of confirmed cases and urged residents to stay home. The patient was a male in his 50s who had an underlying medical condition, Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said. The man “became sick a few days ago, was hospitalized briefly and died in the last couple of days,” Farley said. “Every death is a tragedy. We don’t want to discuss this as just simply statistics,"" Farley said, but added that he could not give additional details out of respect for the family’s privacy. Mayor Jim Kenney said the city’s first death was “truly difficult news,” and also a reminder of the seriousness of the virus and the importance of staying home. “The unfortunate reality is that there will likely be more deaths as the number of cases grow, which is why our stay-at-home order is essential,” Kenney said. “This virus is very real and very deadly.” Kenney said he has extended his shutdown of nonessential city government operations in the city until April 6. It was initially set to expire Sunday. The stay-at-home order remains in effect without a set end date. Farley said there were 342 confirmed cases of the virus in Philadelphia as of Wednesday afternoon, including among city employees. He said there is at least one case among civilian employees, as well as in the fire and police departments. City officials declined to comment on how many city employees have the virus, but said that those who were in contact with them have also been quarantined. About half of the confirmed cases in Philadelphia are in residents younger than 40, Farley said, and 37 of the cases are in health care workers. There is also more than one nursing home resident with the virus, he said. “We can’t save everyone,” Farley said. ""We want to save as many people as possible which is why we’re taking as many steps as we can to try to slow the spread of this infection.” Farley said he could not indicate whether there are specific hot spots within the city where the virus is spreading. “I can only tell you we’ve had cases in every area of the city,” he said. The number of people who have tested positive for the virus in Pennsylvania surpassed 1,000 Wednesday, while 11,193 people have tested negative, according to state health officials.

231,"When coronavirus and gun violence collide, it makes both more deadly | Editorial","The coronavirus pandemic is at present so monumental it has the ability to overshadow everything else — including pressing problems that already exist. In Philadelphia, that includes gun violence. According to data from the Philadelphia Police Department, in the four weeks ending March 22, almost all crime categories — including overall violent crime — saw large declines compared with the prior four weeks. An exception is shootings, which have risen 22%, to 106, in the last four weeks. The bitter irony is that social distancing required by the coronavirus has the potential to make gun violence more deadly — not just because it limits violence interventions, but because it forces gun-wound victims to compete with COVID-19 patients for essential health services. COVID-19 is imposing serious demands on units of blood, ventilators, and personal protective gear for health-care workers. Treating gun victims requires a lot of blood, a product in short supply due to canceled drives. Similarly, gun victims are at high risk of needing ventilators. Trauma surgeon Mark Seamon says that in his hospital, Penn Presbyterian, there are 5 to 15 gun-wound patients on ventilators at any given moment. Social distancing can prove problematic to Philadelphia’s gun violence prevention efforts. Since last June, Philadelphia’s Office of Violence Prevention has disbursed $1.7 million in grants to nearly 100 small community-based nonprofits. Grantees have been told to postpone their projects until further notice to allow them to comply with the city’s stay-at-home order, according to OVP. The city also deploys outreach workers to defuse conflict before it turns to violence. According to an OVP spokesperson, outreach “continues its work,” but the office could not provide specifics on how. Given the severity of the gun violence problem, the Kenney administration should be pressuring the OVP to adapt more quickly — and communicate more. Meanwhile in Chicago, a city that successfully reduced shootings in recent years, gun violence prevention nonprofits are adapting to social distancing. The Institute for Nonviolence Chicago is continuing its outreach work but with new precautions. READI Chicago, which provides jobs and cognitive behavioral therapy, rapidly surveyed the tech capacity of participants and responded to their needs — including at times reimbursements for data plans — to move CBT sessions online. In the coming months, as resources continue to get scarce, focusing efforts on those at risk for violence is going to be more important than ever. City and state officials should not pull the funding out from under the feet of one health crisis to address another. The coronavirus has forced all to make significant alterations in their lives; the city’s efforts at solving gun violence should be no exception. Given the trends we are seeing in Philadelphia, there should be no question that Gov. Tom Wolf must shut down all gun stores. The news of the coronavirus led to a spree of gun purchases, including by first-time gun owners. On March 19, Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close, originally including gun stores. But on the following Tuesday, after pressure from state Supreme Court justices, Wolf reversed course, allowing gun stores to see customers by appointment. This strikes us as unnecessary and dangerous. The case for closing gun stores is even more compelling considering that one crime category that could see an increase because of the coronavirus is domestic violence and child abuse, according to Loyola University New Orleans criminologist Kelly Frailing. People are trapped at home, together, during a very stressful and uncertain time. There are enough terrifying statistics showing that a gun in the home exponentially increases the risk of domestic killings and suicides — as well as accidental shootings. Guns also make for lucrative burglary opportunities. At this time, with high stress and kids out of school playing in the house all day, more than ever, we need fewer guns — not more. If both gun violence and coronavirus continue at their current rates, both COVID-19 and shooting victims will not be able to receive the care they need and deserve. Increased wait times, lack of units of blood, and short supply of ventilators could turn nonfatal shootings into homicides. The greatest challenge at this moment, both for community and government, is to effectively respond to all health threats — especially those that can be just as deadly as the pandemic.

232,What to know about the coronavirus stimulus checks — and how and when you get your money,"Many Americans will soon receive direct payments from the federal government after the U.S. Senate passed a $2.2 trillion rescue package late Wednesday to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The House was expected to pass the measure Friday, the largest economic stimulus in modern American history. The money could especially help Philadelphia, the nation’s poorest big city, where many people work in hotel, airline, and restaurant industries ravaged by the halt in economic activity. “We have more people that are going to need these checks,” said Ron Anderson, dean of Temple University’s Fox School of Business. ""These checks are going to be important for them to pay rent, to get groceries, just to keep the day-to-day things going on. So this is really important to Philadelphia.” Here are answers to some common questions about the coronavirus stimulus checks: Most residents would receive $1,200. Under the bill, single adults who make an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will collect the full $1,200. Those filing as the head of a household and earning up to $112,500 could get the full amount, too. Married couples making up to $150,000 would receive a total of $2,400. Families would also get $500 per child. For those earning more than those thresholds, the payments decrease by $5 for each $100 that a taxpayer’s income exceeds the threshold. The payments completely phase out for individuals making more than $99,000, $146,500 for head-of-household filers, and $198,000 for married couples. No. The Internal Revenue Service would wire payments to people’s bank accounts using information from their 2019 or 2018 tax returns. For those who have not filed for 2018 and 2019, the IRS has said it will use information from the Social Security Administration to send checks by mail, according to the office of. Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.). The best way to ensure you get a check is to file a 2019 tax return. The payments could go out as soon as early April, Toomey said. But for those who don’t have a direct deposit account on file with the IRS, it could take as long as four months to receive a check in the mail, according to reports. Under the bill, the IRS would notify you by mail within weeks after your payment was disbursed. The notice would include how the payment was made and contact information at the IRS to report any missing payments. Just one. Congress would have to take additional action for another round of checks to be sent. No, they are an advanced refunding of a tax credit. You could still qualify if you have no income, or if you rely on nontaxable government programs such as the Supplemental Security Income benefits from Social Security.

233,"Amid coronavirus stay-at-home order, healthy people are learning the ways of the sick | Opinion","This afternoon as I stepped into the shower for, admittedly, the first time in a couple of days, I experienced a familiar flashback. It wasn’t the first time I’d not showered daily. “Social distancing” is what the world is calling this new-to-many experience as an effort to “flatten the curve” of coronavirus cases. But it became my “new normal” several decades ago when I was diagnosed with colon cancer in high school. As a cancer patient on chemotherapy and radiation, I found that this idea of “don’t touch people” was critical. I remember leaving the hospital after getting a shot of cold white blood cells into my rear and being encouraged to avoid people, scrub down fresh foods before eating, and stock up on paper towels to eliminate germs. My family’s scramble to protect my compromised immune system looked a lot like what most people are facing for the first time. In a way, I feel as if I’m watching all of this unfold from a perch I’ve built out of unawareness of my own actions, something I’ve been building as a cancer survivor for more than 20 years. Even though I’m in remission and not facing active disease, I’m realizing that much of my daily life is still ruled by survival mode. When you’re used to being on self-quarantine, you always keep a lot of toilet paper on hand. You’re careful to not spread germs. I’m always aware of how much food, medicine, and emergency funds I have readily accessible. I’ve learned to listen to my body for signs of stress and know to take action before I become ill. I learned long ago not to count on plans made in advance. I often have Plans B, C, and D in the back of my mind. Quarantined life is not easy; it takes some time to adjust. For those who are struggling and suffering, I am truly sorry. The world of the well is learning the ways of the sick. This goes beyond living in pajama pants and cozy socks. This fear of getting sick runs deep, it forces us to consider mortality, and if you’ve never had to face death, never mind planned your own funeral, as I have, it can be really challenging. It’s hard to experience what, until recently, seemed so remote becoming real and hitting home. It’s scary to ponder the financial future and wonder how mounting costs will be covered. Yet these are things chronic disease patients live with every day. Sickness comes with grief; it’s appropriate to mourn. Immuno-compromised patients were (or should have been) stuck inside for weeks before the rest of America joined us. We can show the nation how this is done, and even become a source of strength for our hurting world. Being unwell is scary and concerning, but these times don’t come without redemption and hope. There is life after sickness; this especially carries immense meaning if you’re a person of faith. As someone who spent several days in the cancer isolation room as a teenager, I can promise you this: Things are going to get better. That doesn’t mean we won’t face loss. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t grieve. But if I’ve learned anything from surviving cancer for more than half of my life it’s this: Our pain is fertile soil that can nourish ingenuity, connection, compassion, hope, faith, and love. Our earth, our bodies, and our souls were designed to heal. The sun will come out and the rain will fall. As a season of healing begins to take hold, I hope everyone can learn something patients already know: Do not take one day, one moment, for granted.

242,Fact-checking coronavirus claims by Pennsylvania politicians,"The Inquirer is partnering with PolitiFact, the nonpartisan fact-checking website operated by the nonprofit Poynter Institute for Media Studies. The Inquirer will be PolitiFact’s exclusive partner in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state in the 2020 presidential election. Through the work of an Inquirer reporter dedicated to this effort, and collaborating with other reporters and editors from both The Inquirer and PolitiFact, we will assess the accuracy of statements by elected officials, political candidates, and other public figures. This work is more important now than ever. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, it had become increasingly tough for Pennsylvanians to determine what is true and what’s not. But now, promoting facts and knocking down falsehoods is more important than ever. The truth will help voters elect the next president, and it will help save lives as we confront the growing threat posed by this virus. My name is Jessica Calefati, and I’m your new PolitiFact Pennsylvania reporter. In the months ahead, I’ll be fact-checking statements by the presidential candidates, claims from politicians throughout Pennsylvania, and reports about the coronavirus. Hear a politician say something that sounds fishy? Flag it for me. See a viral post on social media that seems false? Send it my way. You can reach me at jcalefati@inquirer.com. Speaking at a news conference Sunday, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said it best: “Don’t believe everything that you see on the internet or every advertisement.” But be certain you can believe in The Inquirer. To get us started, here are some coronavirus claims made by Pennsylvania officials in recent weeks. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw affirmed her department’s commitment to fighting crime last week after a significant change in policy driven by the coronavirus. “The department is not turning a blind eye to crime,” Outlaw said at a news conference. “No one will escape accountability for the crimes that they commit.” Why would the top cop in a city with shootings on the rise need to publicly vow to tackle crime? Because the virus has fundamentally changed the way Philadelphia’s criminal justice system functions — at least for the time being. First, the courts announced plans to close until April 1. Then Outlaw told her commanders to stop making arrests for nonviolent crimes including drug offenses, theft, and prostitution, among others, according to an internal memo. The move protects police officers from interacting with nonviolent offenders who may be infected with the coronavirus, and given the court closures, it prevents nonviolent offenders from contracting and spreading the virus in jail while waiting for their day in court. Similarly, the New Jersey Supreme Court on Monday ordered county jails to release individuals serving time for low-level offenses. Still, when news about Philadelphia’s policy shift started ricocheting around the Internet, it sounded too crazy to be true. But in fact, it is. And Outlaw’s promise not to let any criminals escape accountability for their crimes is largely accurate, too. That accountability will come in the form of fingerprinting at the scene and arrest warrants that police say they will file once the spread of the virus slows and courts reopen. Will cops be able to find the offenders they fingerprinted once the spread of the virus slows? We’ll have to wait and see. Earlier this month, as confusion over screening for the coronavirus mounted, Sen. Bob Casey vented on Twitter about the scarcity of tests needed to determine who has the virus. “Right now in America, it is easier to get an AR-15 than a test kit for COVID-19,” the Democrat from Pennsylvania tweeted March 13. We wanted to know how Pennsylvanians’ access to firearms compares with the availability of coronavirus tests in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. The answer illustrates how quickly things change as government officials scramble to combat the spread of the virus. When Casey sent that tweet more than a week ago, there were no restrictions on gun sales and demand was high. Customers eyeing a rifle like an AR-15 would have needed to pass an instant background check and show proof that they were over 18. That’s standard procedure. Anxious customers were so eager to stock up on guns and ammo that the line outside a South Philadelphia firearms dealer one recent day stretched out the door and down the block. Meanwhile, tests for the coronavirus were extremely scarce. It was that same day (March 13) that President Donald Trump acknowledged the shortage, declared coronavirus a national emergency, and vowed to make 500,000 tests available the following week. That means Casey’s statement at the time was accurate. But a lot can change in a few days – especially during a pandemic. Sales of firearms ground to a halt Friday after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all businesses not considered “life-sustaining” to close their doors and many counties stopped issuing new license-to-carry permits. Then on Tuesday, Wolf quietly reversed course and allowed gun shops to reopen after several Pennsylvania Supreme Court justices urged him to do so. Firearms dealers may now see customers by appointment as long as they keep them six feet apart inside shops. Pennsylvania’s gun background check system is still “running full bore,” said Trooper Brent Miller, a spokesperson for the State Police, despite rumors that it had been shut down. But until counties reopen their license-to-carry divisions, firearm owners without permits will, in almost all circumstances, not be able to carry the guns they buy without risking arrest. And while there are nowhere near as many coronavirus tests available as Trump promised there would be when he spoke on March 13, the number of Pennsylvanians getting tested is climbing steadily each day. There are now more than a dozen testing sites open in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs, and state health officials say more than 5,000 people have been tested so far. It was easier to get an AR-15 than a coronavirus test when Casey sent that tweet. And for a few days when gun sellers were forced to close their doors, things were different. But now that Wolf has cleared the way for the shops to reopen, it has once again become easier for people to get a semiautomatic rifle than a coronavirus test. The top official in the county that has been at the center of Pennsylvania’s coronavirus outbreak tried to reassure her constituents about the relative safety of the great outdoors during a virtual town hall last week. ""You absolutely can go outside, particularly with the people in... your household, go outside and take walks and get on the trails,” said Val Arkoosh, chair of the Montgomery County Commissioners and a physician. As more places order residents to “shelter in place” to beat back the coronavirus, we wondered whether it’s still safe to take a walk or go for a run. The answer, according to public health officials, is yes. Nate Wardle, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, said going outside is safe, and being inside all day is not healthy. Staying cooped up in the house can “really start to affect our mental health,” said David Damsker, director of the Bucks County Health Department. And Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney’s shelter-in-place order explicitly exempts “walking, running, cycling, operating a wheelchair, or engaging in outdoor activities with immediate family members, caretakers, household members or romantic partners” — as long as you stay six feet away from others. So, yes, Arkoosh’s advice is good advice.

243,The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics because of coronavirus is a blow to Comcast,"The International Olympic Committee will postpone the Summer Games in Tokyo, dealing a blow to Comcast’s NBC Universal, which was set to make more than $1.25 billion in advertising this year by broadcasting the games. The IOC has agreed to push back the games until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tuesday. The virus has infected roughly 400,000  people and caused more than 18,000  deaths worldwide. The postponement is one of several disruptions the Philadelphia media giant faces due to the outbreak. The company warned investors Tuesday that it could face a “material adverse impact"" as the pandemic shuts down theme parks, delays movie releases, and suspends content production, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the stock markets regulator. “This uncertainty makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our businesses, particularly over the near to medium term,” the company wrote in the disclosure. Comcast’s NBCUniversal has a multi-billion-dollar deal to broadcast the Olympics. Earlier this month, NBCUniversal said it received more than $1.25 billion in national advertising commitments for the summer games, which the company said is a new Olympic record. It’s unclear what happens to those ad sales now that the games have been delayed.  “NBCUniversal is actively working with our advertising partners to navigate this postponement, and we’re exploring all options to best serve their brands and our consumers this year, and into 2021,"" an NBCUniversal spokesperson said. In 2011, the company agreed to pay $4.38 billion to broadcast the summer and winter games from 2014 through 2020. That averages to about $1.1 billion per Olympics, though the summer games typically cost more than the winter ones. Earlier this month, Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts said Comcast had insurance to cover its expenses if the Olympics were canceled, though the company wouldn’t profit from what’s usually a boon to its broadcast and cable TV business. In 2016, Comcast raked in $1.6 billion in revenue from the Rio Olympics, including $1.2 billion from advertising, according to a quarterly earnings report. “There should be no losses should there not be an Olympics,"" Roberts said on March 3. ""It just wouldn’t be a profit this year.” The company had also planned to use the Summer Olympics to promote its forthcoming streaming service, called Peacock. The service is set to debut April 15 for Comcast Xfinity customers, and launch nationwide July 15. The Olympics were supposed to start nine days later. “Given the unprecedented obligation we all face to contain COVID-19 globally, we fully understand the decision made by the IOC, Japanese government, and the health organizations they are working with to postpone the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics until 2021,"" an NBC Sports spokesperson said in a statement. ""We have no doubt that the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee will put on an exceptional games next year, and that the Olympic flame will once again unite the world and provide a light at the end of this tunnel.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:46 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:46 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,DRDF274OBREBTPWHZJJX6SWEUA
244,"Will a coronavirus mirage of clean air, water inspire climate action — or make things worse? | Will Bunch","OK, let’s be clear about one thing: Dolphins aren’t actually frolicking in the canals of a deserted Venice, a city on lockdown like the rest of Italy because of the global pandemic. But — as is sometimes the case — those misleading or faked viral tweets are an exaggerated version of something that is true, and also compelling: The shutdown of scores of tourist-packed gondolas has cleaned the murky waters of the ancient city to the point where fish are now visible. And that’s not the only remarkable vision — practically a mirage, really — as the coronavirus crisis shutters the developed world’s economy to levels that resemble pre-Industrial Revolution society. From Beijing to Los Angeles, formerly slow-moving freeways are suddenly all but deserted at the height of rush hour, and the envelope of smog that once greeted those commuters has disappeared as well. Environmentalists have been posting pollution maps and satellite images of clearing skies that hearken to the 18th century. Yet no one is really celebrating such a sudden drop in pollution on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day — not when the cause is a global pandemic that has already taken the lives of more than 500 Americans and at least 17,000 worldwide, with efforts to stem the coronavirus bring about an economic shutdown that may already be causing the biggest disruption since the Great Depression. But on the front lines where scientists and activists have been fighting another planetary threat now abruptly pushed to a back burner — climate change — both the stunning images of blue skies, and gigantic scope of the political and societal interventions to stop coronavirus, raise some inevitable questions. Another world looks possible — but is it all a grand and temporary illusion, to be blurred by a return to normalcy once the all-clear whistle sounds? In other words, will the fierce urgency of now created by the coronavirus — with the likelihood of massive government spending but also talk of significant changes in how to support a social safety net and regulate modern capitalism — create a template for next fighting the slower-moving public health crisis of climate change? Or will the economic lesson from the pandemic — with President Trump itching to defy his medical experts and proclaim America re-opened for business — instead be a craving for even less-fettered capitalism. If some leaders are willing to sacrifice Grandma to prevent a slowdown, what chance does clean air have? I reached out to one of the smartest people I know — the Penn State University climate scientist Michael Mann, whose groundbreaking research led to the so-called “hockey stick graph” of Earth’s rising temperatures and who remains an outspoken voice for climate action. He responded to my email from an airport in wildfire-ravaged Australia, where the coronavirus forced him to cut short a lengthy speaking tour on the warming planet. “On the one hand, this crisis accidentally demonstrates how our ongoing depletion of resources is threatening our planetary environment by providing us at least a fleeting window into what things might look like were we living more sustainability and demanding less from this planet,” he responded. “And as we gradually see the sorts of services and conveniences we’re so used to begin to disappear and get a sense of how fragile our societal infrastructure really is—infrastructure that we now rely upon to support a population of 7.8 billion and growing people that are demanding more food, more fresh water, more space—we are starting to get a sense of how precarious modern civilization really is. We’re only one crisis away from dystopia. That crisis could be climate change if we don’t act now.” It’s also worth noting that Mann is a frequent target of scorn among the climate-denialist right wing, and the seriousness of the coronavirus crisis also raises hope that American society might just be ready again to treat scientific expertise like his with greater respect. But there are, of course, several other hands, beyond the obvious fact that few but the most apocalyptic-minded expect the emptiness of Venice’s canals or the Schuylkill Expressway to last forever. For one thing, both the economic slowdown and some complicated, loosely related geopolitics have caused oil prices to plunge to historic lows — which typically means Americans buying bigger gas guzzlers whenever car buying resumes (especially since the more well-off may also avoid mass transit, due to lingering virus fears). Some experts note that cash-strapped corporations — including some that pledged to become carbon-neutral near the end of the late 2010s economic boom — are now likely to scuttle climate-related capital spending. “Economics trumps environment in politics,” Rob Jackson, Stanford University earth scientist and chair of the Global Carbon Project, told me. He said he remains optimistic about the climate fight but also warned that “if the virus makes us more insular and protectionist, an international consensus to fight global warming may be harder to reach.” The irony, of course, is that the coronavirus crisis and its lockdowns have also made it harder for the young activists most determined to radically change climate policy to protest any corporate or governmental backsliding. For example, a massive climate protest and strike planned for the 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, on April 22, has now become online and digital — with its likely impact unknown. But with events moving so quickly, the short-term course of the climate battle may already be determined by then. In the United States, what happens with a $2-trillion-plus coronavirus-related stimulus package — vehemently being fought over on Capitol Hill as I write this Tuesday morning — will likely show whether the pilots of progressive change or the captains of reactionary capitalism are steering this electric bus. On one side, reform-minded Democrats are essentially arguing that bailing out American big business demands green-minded environmental change as one of the conditions of that relief. The version of the massive stimulus package as drafted by House Democrats offers a significant bailout for the renewable energy sector that includes wind and solar power, and even proposes cuts in pollution in return for the $50 billion chunk sought by the nation’s airlines. Not surprisingly, Republicans and their zealously pro-corporate leader on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, see the notion of saving the planet as something they’re most comfortable with decrying as “social engineering” or “a liberal wish list.” They are eager to race toward the familiar smoggy skies of business as usual — laughing at airline pollution controls even as they consider the American Petroleum Institute’s request to relieve Big Oil from regulations, which sure sounds like reverse social engineering to me. The importance of this moment can’t be understated, because in a society that’s been hopelessly politically gridlocked for at least a decade, this moment of crisis — horrible as it is — is also probably our only real chance at changing the course of this otherwise doomed battleship. We should be imploring our leaders, especially the ones currently quarreling in the corridors of Congress, to ponder the bigger meaning of America’s short-sighted vision in preparing for this pandemic — eliminating key positions and poo-pooing science in general. Do we really want to be here again in 10 or 20 years — or less — over rising sea levels, drought, floods or wildfires ... or deeper fallouts like famine, mass migration or war? Or can we make sure that, in stimulating the suddenly moribund U.S. economy, that we stimulate it away from dirty fossil fuels and towards clean energy? Lawmakers should take a deep breath of the spring air along the Potomac — for one shining moment not tainted by thousands of tailpipes up on the Capitol Beltway — and ponder all the energy and human ingenuity that’s being thrown at the coronavirus, and imagine doing that next for climate change. A better world is possible. You can feel it in the air.

246,Pa. legislature pledges transparency as it prepares to vote remotely on coronavirus relief,"This story was produced as part of a joint effort among Spotlight PA, LNP Media Group, PennLive, PA Post, and WITF to cover how Pennsylvania state government is responding to the coronavirus. Sign up for Spotlight PA’s newsletter. HARRISBURG — When the Pennsylvania House meets this week, its 203 members won’t pack into the ornate Capitol chamber where they usually gather. Instead, most lawmakers will tune in remotely to consider a bill that moves the state’s primary election to June 2. Members of the public will be able to watch what happens by livestream, a measure both the House and Senate are taking to ensure there’s transparency during the coronavirus outbreak. Committee meetings — which usually involve cramming two dozen lawmakers plus members of the public into a small room — will also be streamed live. “One commitment that we do have is to be as transparent as absolutely possible,” Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) said last week. Pennsylvania law says state government entities may only take action during an open and public meeting, with some modifications available during an emergency, according to Erik Arneson, executive director of the state Office of Open Records. But keeping a meeting open and accessible to the public contradicts federal COVID-19 guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends canceling all gatherings of more than 10 people and keeping at least six feet away from another person. When public meetings are done remotely, Arneson said lawmakers must be able “to participate in some way.” While most members of the House do not need to attend proceedings in Harrisburg, only members present on the floor may speak about a bill, said Mike Straub, spokesperson for House Majority Leader Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster). The legislature is better prepared than many state agencies to maintain public access, Arneson said, as it has existing technology to support livestreaming. Smaller agencies may lack critical equipment to communicate with the public. “The thing we keep telling agencies … is, if you have to take action at a meeting where [the public] can’t participate, just be sure to sort of be extra transparent,” Arneson added. “Talk about what you did, give the public the opportunity to comment on it.” Under new rules passed in response to the coronavirus outbreak, rank-and-file members in the House will be able to text or email their votes to each caucus’ whip from home. However, the rules also require some party leaders to be present on the floor in Harrisburg. In the Senate, which may be called on to vote this week, new rules state leadership doesn’t need to preside over the chamber in person, meaning virtually all of its work could be done online. Still, a few members will be present in the chamber, according to Brittany Crampsie, spokesperson for Senate Democrats, while the rest will participate and vote via a video conference. Kate Flessner, a spokesperson for President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson), did not respond to questions about Senate operations but said proceedings will be streamed live. “Now more than ever, every member of our community is looking for some sort of guidance, information, assistance,” State Sen. Scott Martin (R., Lancaster) said. “You’ve got to be accessible for it.” Despite the Senate’s remote-voting rules, Martin said he is prepared to go to the Capitol this week unless Gov. Tom Wolf extends the stay-at-home order to Lancaster County. If that happens, Martin said, he’s ready to log in to the Senate’s video conference to participate in the floor discussion. Leadership in both the House and Senate said lawmakers will only vote on coronavirus-related legislation for the near future. That includes the bill to move the state’s primary from April 28 to June 2. On Monday, at least a dozen members of the House State Government Committee met in Harrisburg to advance the legislation. Some lawmakers sat side by side — approximately a foot apart — inside a Capitol meeting room. “It’s kind of important for elected leaders to be on the forefront and show up to work,” said State Rep. Seth Grove (R., York), a member of the committee, who attended Monday’s meeting. “We ask that of our health-care professionals, first responders.... I just think it’s my duty as an elected leader to physically show up for work.” On Twitter, State Rep. Kevin Boyle, a Philadelphia Democrat who co-chairs the committee, said members of his caucus “all took proper social distancing measures.” 100% ESSENTIAL: Spotlight PA provides its journalism at no cost to newsrooms across the state as a public good to keep our communities informed and thriving.

234,"What’s in the coronavirus stimulus bill? Individual checks, billions for small businesses, and more. ","Help could soon be on its way to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments impacted by the coronavirus outbreak thanks to a deal struck early Wednesday between lawmakers in the Senate and the Trump administration. According to a draft of the legislation, which is still subject to change, obtained by The Inquirer, it will include a massive boost to unemployment assistance, increasing the amount people receive by $600 a week for four months, and including freelancers, independent contractors, and furloughed employees. Here’s an overview of some other noteworthy items in the $2 trillion bill: In addition, the federal government will send one-time checks to most Americans, depending on their income level: A family of four that made less than $150,000 last year will receive $3,400. Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) said the money is expected to be paid in the first or second week of April, and most of it will be paid as wire transfers to individual bank accounts. Pennsylvania will receive about $5 billion in aid from the bill, according to Toomey. Toomey also said the bill includes an employee retention tax credit for companies too large to qualify for small business loans. It will be a direct dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to 50% of employees’ wages, which Toomey said will “enable a lot of medium and large businesses to retain their workforce.” He added: “We’re hoping it’s a mechanism to keep businesses alive for a few weeks or months until our economy can resume.” It had been hoped that the bill would be approved Wednesday, but last-minute disagreements put that into doubt.

236,Mayor Kenney accuses Hahnemann owner of ‘trying to make a buck’ on the coronavirus,"Update: Mayor Jim Kenney on Thursday said the city has ended negotiations to use the former hospital and will instead pursue other options. As Philadelphia officials scramble to expand the city’s hospital capacity in time to handle the expected surge of patients with the coronavirus, Mayor Jim Kenney accused the owner of the former Hahnemann University Hospital site on Tuesday of “trying to make a buck” out of the pandemic by seeking a high rent for his building. But Joel Freedman, the California businessman who owns the property, said he believes his offer to rent the property for almost $1 million a month is “a very reasonable, heartfelt offer to the City of Philadelphia,"" his spokesperson said in response to Kenney’s comments. City officials are negotiating with Freedman for the hospital, which closed last summer after American Academic Health System, which owned it, filed for bankruptcy. The property itself is owned by Freedman and was not part of the bankruptcy. Brian Abernathy, Philadelphia’s managing director, said at a news conference Tuesday that negotiations with Freedman have been challenging. “I think he is looking at this as a business transaction rather than providing an imminent and important need to the city and our residents,” Abernathy said. Freedman is also frustrated with the negotiations, but wants to help the city, said spokesperson Sam Singer. He said Freedman offered to rent the 500-bed facility at a daily rate of $60 per bed, which would total about $910,000 per month. (Singer said earlier Tuesday that the rate would be $70 per bed per day, which would have totaled more than $1 million per month; he corrected the figure hours after The Inquirer published it.) A city spokesperson said Freedman was seeking about $1 million per month in rent plus estimated fees. Singer noted that California is paying $2.6 million per month to use a shuttered 366-bed hospital in Los Angeles during the pandemic. “What we’re proposing is a hugely, deeply, discounted rate compared to other known comparable situations,” Singer said. “We want to be of assistance to the city and to the community.” Kenney disagreed with that characterization of Freedman’s offer. “We have the owner of the Hahnemann hospital jacking up monthly prices,” he said. “People will take advantage of trying to make a buck out of this, and I think that again is sad.” As of Tuesday afternoon, 23 patients with the coronavirus were hospitalized in Philadelphia, said Public Health Commissioner Thomas Farley. Officials expect that number to grow and are worried that the city could run out of hospital beds for patients, as has happened in other places around the world. Even if the city can reach an agreement with Freedman, it could prove difficult to prepare the hospital to reopen as a medical facility. Conversion would require “extensive work,"" Mike Dunn, a spokesperson for the city, said Tuesday. He said the city is hoping to find a facility that could hold several hundred beds. State Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Tuesday that reopening the hospital would be “really unlikely,” but signaled that she would leave it up to Philadelphia officials. “It has been empty for six months,"" she said. “I think it would be really challenging to stand up a facility such as Hahnemann.” The hospital’s closure sparked an uproar over lost jobs, medical residency positions, and fears that Philadelphia’s most vulnerable citizens would lose a needed care option. Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders even chimed in at one point. The clamor to reopen it has been significant, but its condition — right now it doesn’t have any beds — has been a stumbling block. Weeks ago, city officials discussed using Hahnemann not as an acute-care hospital, but as a quarantine site for people who had no other place to go. If that were to happen, it would not require state licensure. Abernathy said discussions are also ongoing about other potential sites, which he declined to name. The city also has a lease for the Holiday Inn Express in Center City, which Abernathy said Tuesday would be used as a quarantine site for homeless residents as well as other people who are unable to isolate at their homes.

TL;DR: New Jersey now has the second-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, behind only New York. That could prove even more troubling, as Pennsylvania and New Jersey won’t have enough life-saving ventilators for the most critically ill patients. In national news, lawmakers in Washington seem close to reaching a nearly $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus deal to help workers and businesses impacted by the coronavirus.

Track the spread here. There are only 2,000 ventilators in Pennsylvania and 1,700 in New Jersey, meaning if we continue to see a surge in coronavirus cases, hospitals won’t have enough ventilators to save the most critically ill patients. My colleagues Jason Laughlin and Wendy Ruderman report on the potential consequences of this inadequate supply, and how it mirrors what is happening across the country. “It’s a frighteningly low number,"" Jeremy M. Kahn, professor of critical care medicine and health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh, said of Pennsylvania’s numbers. This is one of the reasons why steps like social distancing, and in some cases, a lockdown, are crucial, my colleague Marie McCullough reports. It may be too late considering the escalation of cases in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but Meghan Lane-Fall, an intensive care doctor, anesthesiologist, and researcher at Penn Medicine, wrote it could still help ""give everyone who falls to this virus the best chance.” You can read more from Dr. Drew Harris, a population health and health policy analyst at Thomas Jefferson University about how flattening the coronavirus curve goes way beyond science. More and more testing sites are popping up around the region. But for most, you can’t just show up. Some hospitals may only accept referrals from doctors in their networks, other sites require you to make an appointment. In any case, you should call your primary care doctor, if you have one, and tell them about your symptoms. If you have common coronavirus symptoms, which can include a dry cough and fever, and are a medical worker or at a high-risk (age 65 and older, immunocomprised, or have an underlying medical condition) you are more likely to be able to get a test. But if you are not feeling sick, you do not need to get a test, Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said Friday near the new site outside Citizens Bank Park. “If you don’t have symptoms, "" Farley said, “you don’t need a test. Don’t bother coming here."" My colleague Erin McCarthy compiled a list of local testing sites, requirements, and useful numbers. 🐶 Forget dog vs. mailman.

238,Coronavirus means casinos across the U.S. are losing big,"At some point, the economic suffocation caused by the coronavirus pandemic will relent. But for casinos, simply opening the doors won’t release the pressure, according to a report Tuesday from Standard & Poor’s. The worry of a recession aside, S&P expects casinos to continue to be hurt by social-distancing restrictions and customer travel hesitancy even after the coronavirus is deemed under control. S&P’s report did have a glimmer of hope for casinos in the Philadelphia region. “We believe regional gaming markets are more likely to recover faster than destination markets like Las Vegas,"" the forecast said, ""because most customers are able to drive to those properties instead of fly, which reduces the cost of these trips and potential lingering travel fears associated with the virus.” ",2020-04-05 10:02:46 UTC,2020-04-05 10:02:46 UTC,"-74.194188332210331,40.981164736109228,-76.467791908698715,38.676157795304704",2,,MNULGFLF6BFWXBBR42ZQA2SJBQ
239,How you may be able to get tested for the coronavirus in the Philadelphia area,"As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. With coronavirus cases increasing and health officials warning that the worst is yet to come, more and more individuals are getting tested in the Philadelphia area. Officials recently advised that not everyone needs to be tested. But if you have coronavirus symptoms, which can include a dry cough and fever, and are at high risk (age 65 and older, or immunocompromised), you may be able to get a test near your home. In most cases, however, you can’t just show up to a testing site, and some hospitals may accept referrals only from doctors in their networks. If you think you need to be tested, call your primary care doctor first, if you have one. You may be able to schedule a virtual consultation. A medical professional can best evaluate symptoms and determine whether to refer you for a test, perhaps at one of the following sites. Large health insurance companies and Medicare and Medicaid have said they will cover the cost of testing. Many states have mandated coverage with no co-pays or deductibles. Cooper Health patients can call 800-826-6737 or request an appointment online. Crozer-Keystone patients can call the Crozer-Keystone Health System’s coronavirus hotline at 610-447-6730.

240,"Sixers’ Joel Embiid to donate $500,000 for coronavirus relief, was set to help team employees","Joel Embiid is stepping up. The 76ers center has decided to donate $500,000 to the COVID-19 medical relief to help survival and protection efforts in the community. The three-time All-Star was also going to help at-will Sixers employees, who were expected to temporarily have their salaries reduced. But Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Sixers and New Jersey Devils, reversed their Monday’s decision for at-will employees for both teams making more than $50,000 were informed Monday of temporary salary reductions of up to 20%. The reductions were set for April 15 through June 30. HBSE was looking to recoup some of its lost revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic and the uncertainty of the NBA and NHL’s suspended seasons.  Sixers managing partner Josh Harris and co-managing partner David Blitzer are the cochairmen of HBSE. All NBA games were suspended March 11. League commissioner Adam Silver announced the next day that play would be suspended for at least 30 days. However, the NBA might not resume until June at the earliest. Globally, there have been around 384,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 16,600 deaths. There are about 46,600 confirmed cases and 600 deaths in the United States. The Sixers announced Thursday that three members of the organization have tested positive for COVID-19. The three tests brought the NBA’s number of coronavirus cases to at least 14.

241,Nursing homes in Philadelphia and New Jersey report 17 cases of the new coronavirus.  What should happen now?,"As a public service, The Inquirer is making this article and other critical public health and safety coverage of the coronavirus available to all readers. A Philadelphia nursing home said Tuesday that 11 of its residents and a contract employee have tested positive for the new coronavirus since March 19. Three residents and two staff members of a nursing home in Mount Laurel have also tested positive for the new coronavirus over the last week, the facility’s medical director said. None of the patients has died but one from Philadelphia and three from New Jersey are hospitalized. James Garrow, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, said the department is investigating potential cases in two other city nursing homes, but declined to provide more information. Nursing home residents are especially vulnerable to the new virus, a fact that became starkly evident during an outbreak of coronavirus at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, near Seattle, early in America’s experience with the new disease. As of last week, 35 residents who contracted the virus had died. The disease has found its way into at least 10 other senior facilities in the Seattle area. On Monday, the state announced 30 cases — 24 residents and six staff — at a nursing home in northern Washington state. Brian Dries, a spokesperson for Renaissance Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia, said one of the 123-bed facility’s residents began exhibiting symptoms of the disease caused by the new virus, COVID-19, on March 19. That patient, who is now hospitalized, was immediately placed in isolation and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health identified other residents who may have been in contact with the infected patient. Results from the other patients came back on Monday. Those who tested positive are being cared for in a separate section of the facility. Dries said Renaissance does not know how the initial resident became infected. Visits to patients were stopped before the patient was identified, and the facility was following health department guidance about infection prevention, he said. He said the staff member who tested positive provided therapy to residents and had not been to Renaissance since March 11. The employee is recuperating at home. “The facility is doing everything it can to ensure it stops the spread of this virus within the facility,” Dries said. He said family members are being kept abreast by phone and email. “Everyone’s very supportive, understands this current time that we’re all in,” he said. He said Renaissance has adequate protective equipment for staff. It is actively screening staff before each shift and has “implemented aggressive cleaning procedures.” In a news release, Andrew Blank, medical director of the New Jersey facility, Laurel Brook Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center, said the residents of Laurel Brook  were being treated at a regional hospital and the employees were at home with mild symptoms. The 220-bed nursing home also said it is working closely with New Jersey and U.S. public health officials to contain spread of the respiratory virus. It is monitoring all residents and employees for symptoms and has told employees to stay home if they have any respiratory symptoms. Before the outbreak, the facility also had suspended visitation for residents. That policy will continue, Blank said. Laurel Brook is encouraging family members to connect with loved ones through telephone and video calls, email, and other forms of messaging. The Burlington County Health Department said it will be tracing contacts of people who have interacted with the five sick people but “cannot provide further details at this time."" The state Department of Health did not respond to questions.  Nationally, many senior facilities have greatly restricted visitors in an attempt to keep the new coronavirus out. Many fear they will run out of protective equipment for their staffs, a key tool in infection control. Nursing home residents are often elderly and frail, a population at particularly high risk for death and serious complications from the new virus. Many also share rooms and need help with activities like getting dressed or brushing teeth. Social distancing between them and staff members is not an option. Many nursing homes, including Laurel Brook, also have sections that specialize in shorter-term stays for rehabilitation after a time in a hospital. Those patients also must work closely with therapists and other staff members. David A. Nace, a University of Pittsburgh physician, said that nursing homes have been doing their best to keep the virus out, but that it is inevitable that the new coronavirus will get into more facilities. “It’s unfortunate that, once it comes in, it will spread,” said Nace, president-elect of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which represents medical professionals who work in nursing homes. Nace said that even well-run nursing homes are at risk for significant outbreaks. “You have a very vulnerable population in close contact,” he said. “I think we will see more [situations like Kirkland] despite best attempts and best efforts. Our hope is that we’ll get lucky with this.” On the government’s Nursing Home Compare website, Laurel Brook received an overall rating of four out of five stars, with five stars for quality and three (average) for health inspections and staffing.  In its most recent Nursing Home Compare rating,  for Renaissance  a federal website, it received an overall score of two out of five starts, or below average. It received four starts for quality, but two for health inspections and three for staffing.  Nursing homes, Nace said, serve multiple populations — long-term residents as well as people who have come for end-of-life care, such as palliative care and hospice. Long-term residents live an average of about two years after admission. People who come for rehabilitation after surgery or a heart attack tend to be younger and healthier. He said some nursing homes are currently balking at taking new admissions from hospitals because they’re worried those patients could bring the disease with them. He thinks staff members are the bigger risk, but said hospitals need to identify patients who have recovered from the disease, still have it, or have been exposed. He outlined measures nursing homes should be thinking about once they have a known coronavirus case on campus: “The first thing,"" Nace said, ""is don’t panic.” Staff writer Allison Steele contributed to this article.
