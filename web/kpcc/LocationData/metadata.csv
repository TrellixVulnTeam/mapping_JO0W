STAPLES CENTER
Outside the Staples Center, hundreds of fans have gathered to pay tribute to Bryant.
""Can't believe this is happening,"" said Petey Reina, a Lakers fan who showed up to L.A. Live with a big, framed portrait of Bryant. ""It's a sad day for basketball and the world."" HOLLYWOOD
In Hollywood, fans laid gold letters reading ""RIP Kobe Bryant"" in a vacant star on the Walk of Fame. Sticky notes adorned a mural of Bryant on the side of a Shoe Palace store on Melrose Avenue as flowers and candles sit on the sidewalk below. Fans also showed up at UCLA Health Training Center where the Lakers train. Bryant, 41, was among passengers and a pilot killed a helicopter crash Sunday morning in Calabasas. Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, was also aboard. Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa confirmed that its head baseball coach, John Altobelli, was killed in the crash.
L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said at an afternoon news conference that nine people were on the flight manifest. He said he would not confirm the identities any of the victims until the coroner has identified family members.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Elizabeth Robinson,SSDFBRZQA5A7RE3TBCAYTCLIAE,1

LAist has already made you a real talk postpartum guide for the other side of childbirth, but first you have to deliver the human creature that's growing inside your body. Some people put together a birth plan for the occasion, which lays out a woman's detailed preferences from birthing ball to breastfeeding.
Sometimes those birth plans include the services of doula, but, not everyone knows what a doula does — and not all doulas do the same thing.
OK, BUT WHAT EXACTLY IS A DOULA? Broadly, doulas provide expecting and new mothers with educational, emotional, and advocating support before, during and after a baby is born.
Doulas are non-medical birth workers. They are not doctors or midwives. They don't deliver babies and they do not make medical decisions on a client's behalf.
Think of them more like coaches or advocates for pregnant women and their partners as they approach their due date, while they're giving birth and during the postpartum phase.
""The purpose is that the clients are educated, empowered, and inspired to make informed decisions for a healthy birth outcome,"" wrote Compton doula Bethany Benson. I ALREADY HAVE QUESTIONS
We did too. There's a lot to consider here. Like, how do I interview a doula? How do you know they're qualified? Will insurance cover their services? What exactly are their services? What are the advantages? Are there any disadvantages? Also, how do I find one? LAist readers sent us more than a dozen questions like this, and we spoke with 20 California doulas to get answers. BUT FIRST, A VERY BRIEF HISTORY
Doulas have existed in one form or another since ancient times. Before hospitals and modern medical care, women typically were assisted by family members while she gave birth at home. The word doula comes from a Greek word for female helper.
DO DOULAS HAVE ANY AFFECT ON BIRTH EXPERIENCES? LAist reader Anne Buster told us that working with a doula when her sons were born created a better birth environment. She asked, ""Do statistics back this up?"" ""Better"" is a subjective term, but there is data about birth outcomes:
A 2016 study of Medicaid-funded births found women who worked with a doula were less likely to have a preterm birth or cesarean section (this could also save health insurers nearly $1,000 per birth).
A 2017 review of more than two dozen studies around the world found that women who received ""continuous support"" (like what a doula provides) during labor were less likely to have a cesarean section and could use fewer pain medications.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in 2014 that ""published data indicate that one of the most effective tools to improve labor and delivery outcomes is the continuous presence of support personnel, such as a doula.""
Doulas are also increasingly viewed as key to efforts to reverse birth disparities experienced by women of color.
In Los Angeles County, African American infants die at three times the rate for white infants and new black mothers die at disproportionately high rates.
""The data are showing doula support during pregnancy and during the labor and delivery period can help to sort of mitigate some of these risks,"" said Rachel Hardeman, a University of Minnesota researcher who specializes in reproductive health equity. ""I think we should be careful to understand that like, this is one piece of this bigger puzzle."" THE BIRTH PLANS
The doulas LAist spoke with said they support women with a variety of birth plans, including hospital births, cesarean sections, vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), medicated births and non-medicated births.
In other words, said Los Angeles doula Michelle Sanders, ""we don't try to force you to have your baby out in the woods without medication. If you want all the medication, tell me that and I will go down the list of all the medications and interventions with you so that you know what they are.""
Long Beach doula Stevie Merino emphasizes she wants to provide non-judgmental support to clients.
""I'm not going to project what I want for you, onto you,"" she said. Each doula will have their own areas of expertise and their own way of doing things, but here are some examples of what to expect from a doula when you're expecting.
VISITS BEFORE THE BIG DAY
Doulas have prenatal meetings at the client's home, or wherever they're comfortable. Those meetings vary in length from an hour to several hours. It also might be more than one meeting. Possible agenda items: Help create a plan for birth 
Suggest stretches or exercises
Give dietary information
Attend doctor's appointments
Provide childbirth and infant care education
Coach a partner, family member or friend on how to support the mom
Create herbal or essential oil treatments
Offer pain management techniques
Generally answer questions about birth, including those related to anatomy and physiology
Suggest ways families can prepare for postpartum — including physical healing, breastfeeding, and self-care strategies Many doulas LAist talked to also frequently communicate with their clients via text to help answer questions before and after birth.
IN THE ROOM DURING THE BIRTH
Doulas are on-call in the time leading up to labor. Most also have a trusted back-up doula in case they're not able to attend the birth. During labor doulas can offer:
Massage
Guided visualizations
Help with positioning the mother
Taking photos and document the birth process
Advocacy for the wishes of the birth plan
But births don't always go according to plan. Sometimes families have to make unexpected decisions, like whether to have a c-section, episiotomy or induce labor.
Cyndi Whitwell, who has been a doula in for more than 30 years in Sacramento, asks doctors to give her clients five minutes to consider any major changes.
""It's really helping them take a step back, take a breath and examine their options and decide what's best for them,"" Whitwell said.
POSTPARTUM VISITS
You did it! There's a baby.
Doulas can return to your home to answer any questions you might have about breastfeeding, your baby's health, your healing body, mental health — and they might even stock you freezer with padsicles. Some doulas are exclusively postpartum-focused. A doula might also just stop by to watch the baby and provide a little relief — maybe long enough for you to even take an uninterrupted shower!
""My doula has visited me several times, brought food, washed dishes, checked on the baby, binded my belly and ensured that I was doing well mentally and emotionally (postpartum anxiety and depression, not here!),"" new mom La Mikia Castillo told us. ""I am so grateful for her support during this critical stage as I transition into motherhood with a newborn.""
Other postpartum services doulas can offer:
Placenta encapsulation (though this would need to be arranged ahead of time)
Sleep consulting
Emotional and other support through stillbirths and miscarriages
Several of the doulas LAist talked to say they stay in touch with clients as their babies grow up.
HOW TO FIND A DOULA IN L.A. (or anywhere, really)
You can look for a doula through local and national registries. Many doulas may also have their own websites and social media accounts. Here are some Southern California resources:
Kindred Space: doula support, midwifery, childbirth education classes, lactation consulting support groups, birthworker training.
LOOM: pregnancy and breastfeeding classes, and a doula directory.
Long Beach Birthworkers of Color Collective: doula services on a sliding scale, doula trainings.
Village Birth: childbirth education classes, doula services, support groups.
Bini Birth: doula services, childbirth education classes, doula trainings.
Bundle of Joy: doula services, childbirth education classes.
Los Angeles Birth Partners: doula services, childbirth education, lactation consultations.
Joy in Birthing Foundation: pro bono doula services for low-income families, doula training.
SBCC Thrive LA: community-based doula services.
Baby Brilliance: doula, childbirth education, newborn care specialist services and referrals.
The Birth Co-op: childbirth education, doula services and referrals.
National/International
DONA International: doula training, certification, doula directory.
Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA): doula, childbirth and lactation training, certification, doula and educator directory.
Doula Trainings International: doula trainings, certification, doula directory.
Black Women Birthing Justice: advocacy group, doula directory. WHAT TO ASK WHEN DECIDING WHO TO HIRE
First, ask yourself some questions:
What do you want out of your experience with a doula?
Is your doula's personal background a factor?
Do you want to work with someone who can support you in breastfeeding or provides a specific service?
Are there family or cultural traditions that you want to include in your birth plan?
How much can you afford to pay?
Interview several doulas (three is a good number) and ask questions like:
What is your experience?
What services do you offer? ""Find someone who you like to talk to and you feel comfortable with, someone who inspires you and makes you feel confident and trusting in yourself!"" wrote doula Rebecca Belenky. ""Most people feel a lot of judgement from others during pregnancy and parenting, you should not feel judgment from your doula as well.""
Orange County doulas Marlee and Megan Malone-Franklin suggest asking about a doula's journey to birth work and how they approach working with partners and care providers.
Then, back to the personal questions:
Does the doula make you feel at ease?
Can you imagine being vulnerable in front of them?
""Each doula has a different personality and skill set,"" said Darla Burns, a doula from Santa Clarita. ""Who could you imagine being in that intimate space when you are in pain? Who would comfort you the best? It's not just about experience and price, there has to be a connection with the doula.""
IS THERE ANY SORT OF DOULA CERTIFICATION?
Well, yes and no.
There are local and national organizations that certify doulas. Usually the certifications require several days of training in areas like childbirth education, attending births, breastfeeding, and providing physical and emotional support. Programs can also require continuing education and recertification after a certain number of years. Some doula trainings do not offer a certificate, and some doulas might choose not to seek a program that does.
Doula Stevie Merino says there are questions within the birthworker community about who are considered the gatekeepers of birthing information and as a result, who is able to offer services.
She co-founded the Birthworkers of Color Collective, which offers a three-day doula training in Long Beach.
HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST?
Each doula sets their own rate for attending the birth and prenatal and postpartum visits. That range in Los Angeles is typically from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.
Doulas who responded to our question about this said they take a variety of payments:
Cash
Check
Credit Card
Venmo
PayPal
Barter for goods or services
IS HEALTH INSURANCE GOING TO PAY FOR ANY OF THIS?
This was the most frequent question we received.
LAist reached out to several of California's largest health-care insurers.
Blue Shield of California, L.A. Care Health Plan and Kaiser Permanente told us they do not cover doula services.
""At this time, doulas are not considered essential to maternity care and therefore not covered by Blue Shield of California,"" said a spokesman via email. Marianna Volodarskiy, regional clinical director for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, wrote the company is aware of the increasing interest in doula services and research on their benefits. ""We continue to monitor for evidence validating this information.""
A spokesperson for for L.A. Care Health Plan said the organization is ""currently researching the benefits of doula services, including the feasibility of making them available to targeted members.""
UnitedHealthCare does not cover doula services, but a spokesperson said people with a health savings account could apply those funds to paying for a doula.
Medi-Cal currently does not include doulas as a covered service. At least two states, Minnesota and Oregon, include doula services as part of Medicaid.
Some doulas work through a non-profit organization or independently to provide free or low-cost services to low-income families. In addition to typical doula services, these community-based doulas can offer referrals to other resources.
The L.A. County Department of Public Health is currently piloting a program that provides free doula services to African American women in parts of the county with the largest numbers of black infant deaths.
CAN I HEAR SOME REAL LIFE STORIES OF WHAT IT'S LIKE?
Yes! Many of the people who wrote us back said we could share their stories. The overall takeaway was that their doulas helped keep them calm, advocated for their health and provided a valuable source of information.
Sara Lutz hired a doula to help with the birth of her third and fourth children. ""When we hit some rough patches with the pushing stage...she was the one holding me up and moving my dreadfully tired body into the positions my baby needed me in.""
""I have two children and we worked with the same (amazing) doula for both births,"" wrote Jessica Yarger. ""She acted as a guide through the birth process, an advocate in the hospital, a support for my spouse, was an educated impartial sounding board when decisions had to be made, and helped me at all times stay in tune with my body. She reminded me over and over that my body was built for birthing.""
""They are the eyes and ears, knowing what a mother needs and wants, when I was so deep in labor, that I couldn't have spoken for myself,"" wrote Marisa Davis. ""There is a calm and patience, with knowledge, that a partner can't have. And a dedication and intimacy that the doctor, or in my case, the midwife, doesn't engage in."" Orange County dad Jose Escobar says he was skeptical about his wife Elizabeth's desire to have a doula when she was pregnant with their son in 2016.
But as they worked through their doula's ""birth boot camp"" program, he started to change his mind.
""The knowledge, methods and preparedness they provide was so valuable for us to feel confident during pregnancy and feel more ready during labor,"" he said.
When Elizabeth was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, their doula accompanied her to her appointments with a dietician. When their plan to have their baby at a birthing center went out the window during a 33-hour labor, their doula followed them to the hospital, too.
""I get there and I'm being bombarded with just like, nurses and there was like, student nurses or student doctors and all just kind of stuff,"" Elizabeth said.
Their doula was a buffer. And Jose said he felt empowered to have a role in the birth of their son whether it was coaching Elizabeth through breathing exercises or helping manage pain.
""That was major for me, just knowing what to expect and how to have the right frame of mind to be able to help my wife,"" he said.
Despite their success, the Escobars did not have a doula when their daughter was born a few years later. One factor was cost.
""It's like a luxury, when I really don't think it should be considered a luxury,"" Elizabeth said.
UPDATE, Jan. 23, 2 p.m.: This guide was updated to include additional doula service organizations.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Mariana Dale,QKEPAKE53RA3RJWUIFB4CYUYUA,1

That worries people like Arbi Sardari, as he takes a drag of peach- and mint-flavored tobacco at The Atmosphere, the hookah lounge he owns in Glendale.
For Sardari, smoking a hookah brings back memories of family.
""My grand grandpa was doing hookah,"" Sardari said. ""And I was the kid that he was always saying, 'Hey, go put some charcoal on for me.'""
For many Middle Eastern families in California, smoking flavored tobacco with a hookah pipe is a communal affair, both at lounges like Sardari's and at home.
Sardari said he slept in his car for weeks to save up enough money to start his business. Now it's the proposed state law that's keeping him up at night.
""Because you think, wow, I'm doing all this and tomorrow it's gone?"" he said, adding that he has 14 employees.
Customer Asbjorn Kjaer said he'd be bummed if he couldn't enjoy smoking a hookah with a few friends on a sunny afternoon.
""The whole thing where they're trying to outlaw all sorts of flavored tobacco seems to be mainly an overreaction to a serious problem with teen smoking, teen vaping,"" Kjaer said.
Hookah advocates will often argue that hookah pipes are not what contributes to teen smoking, as they take a considerable amount of time to get going and are not easily concealable.
Backers of the bill — SB 793 — say it's ""aimed at halting the alarming resurgence of nicotine consumption among youth,"" according to a press release announcing the measure from co-sponsor State Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo).
The bill would ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products with no exceptions. It has the backing of 30 lawmakers and is supported by the American Cancer Society and several other health advocacy groups.
""Anything less than ridding store shelves of all flavored tobacco products, including menthol, hookah, cigars, cigarillos and chewing tobacco, diminishes the health and safety of California kids who will find a way to access flavored tobacco anywhere retailers are able to sell these alluring products,"" Jim Knox, managing director for the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network in California, said in a statement announcing SB 793.
There's no argument that hookah smoking can be harmful to your health. ""hookah smoking has many of the same health risks as cigarette smoking,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns on its website. The agency says hookah smokers may be at risk for oral cancer, lung cancer and other diseases.
Rima Khoury, an attorney with the San Diego-based hookah tobacco and gear company Fumari, is actively lobbying to make sure the L.A. City Council has a hookah exemption carved out in its proposed flavored tobacco ban.
She said she wouldn't want her kids smoking but argues that there's no teen hookah epidemic and that efforts to combat youth vaping shouldn't take out a centuries-old cultural practice.
""We don't want hookah to become collateral damage,"" Khoury said.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Robert Garrova,QB5EG7X7W5E2BHVPQ4I6EKH72Q,1

Over the last few years, I have devoted myself to a singular, some would say impossible, quest — to sample every taco in northwest Pasadena. Like Ahab chasing his white whale, I have pursued this mission with a single-minded ferocity. I have tasted tacos in humble carnicerias and massive supermarkets, in grungy liquor stores and all-night donut shops, in claustrophobic drive-throughs and cement driveways. In any given week, my neighborhood has about 30 different taco spots. My personal ""Taco District"" — bounded by Washington Blvd. to the north, Lake Ave. to the east, the 210 to the south and Lincoln Blvd. to the west — is a one-square-mile swath with Garfield Heights, my quaint micro-hood, planted in the middle. The area isn't large but even within these modest geographic limits, to savor and study the taco is a life's work.
I intend to publish the fruits of my research, ""The Northwest Pasadena Taco Survey,"" later this year. In the meantime, I invite LAist readers to savor the highlights. Máquina Taco
Opened in November 2018, Máquina Taco has established itself as one of the most cutting-edge taquerias in town. Chef Greg Lukasiewicz, after tinkering with his taco concepts at a pop-up, partnered with a local fruit cart (it's now stationed outside Máquina when not parked at the Rose Bowl). The standard menu features traditional asada, pollo and al pastor as well as pork belly mole, duck, lamb and octopus but the ambitious and imaginative specials are where it's at. They might include elk and bacon, sweetbreads, venison, lobster, wild boar, chicken heart, jackfruit mole and chapulines (grasshoppers) marinated with dried chile then flash-fried to a light crisp. You can request any of these in a burrito or a bowl but if you do, you'll miss out on the fabulous blue corn tortillas from Kernel of Truth Organics. Tacos cost $3 to $9 and lines have grown longer since the Los Angeles Times gave the place a glowing review. Thankfully, an addition to the dining room has expanded the restaurant's capacity. If you have to wait, sip a watermelon agua fresca, enjoy the jazz piping through the speakers and bask in the afternoon sun warming the annex.

If you're a fan of the namesake offerings at Highland Park's El Huarache Aztecas — sandal-shaped slabs of fried masa topped with veggies, cheese and meat — you can now find them in another spot. In 2017, members of the Rodriguez family opened Mi Rinconcita Azteca near Orange Grove Blvd. and Raymond Ave. In addition to huaraches, the small, vibrant corner shop features an expanded menu of barbacoa, moles and a daily desayuno (breakfast), all prepared in ""estilo D.F."" for fans of Mexico City's fare. The lamb barbacoa, served only on weekends, is a thing of beauty. Marinated in the secret family recipe and slow-roasted, it's sold by the pound and served with a traditional cup of rich consommé. Vegetarians can opt for squash blossoms and huitlacoche, the savory mushroom-like corn fungus. Credit for all this goes to Alfredo Rodriguez; his wife, Mariela; and their son, Greg, who imbue the place with a welcoming vibe. Your check might come with a hand-written post-it offering thanks and bestowing blessings upon you.

Located at Orange Grove Blvd. and Fair Oaks Ave., Los Primos specializes in large Ensenada-style fish and shrimp tacos — battered and fried hunks of fish served on 6-inch tortillas heaped with shredded cabbage and drizzled with crema. (The Gobernador adds cheese and green pepper.) Choose basic cod ($5.25) or shrimp. If you want something less common, there's marlin. Although iceberg lettuce occasionally stands in for cabbage, the seafood is fresh and the batter fries to a light yet convincing crisp. Los Primos also offers street-style tacos with your choice of a dozen fillings including tripe, sesos (brains) and buche (the outer lining of a cow's stomach) for $1.75 apiece. The place gets busy at lunch but the dinner shift seems to elicit more attention from the chef.

A fixture on the corner of Lincoln Ave. and Orange Grove Blvd. for more than two decades, Vero's Restaurant is a shrine to Pancho Villa. The walls of the dimly lit dining room are festooned with images of the revolutionary hero alongside plaques explaining his legacy. As for their tacos, Vero's puts its best foot forward with conventional fillings such as carnitas, pollo and lengua ($1.75 each). Look for deals on Wednesdays, when you might score grilled or fried shrimp tacos that typically cost $2.50 for as low as $1. Portions are generous. The battered and fried filet in your fish taco will likely dwarf your tortillas and the crema drizzled on the iceberg lettuce is spiked with chili powder. Plus, fresh chips and salsa come with every order.

Like stars in the sky, we are blessed with many La Estrellas, all of which loosely belong to the same family. In fact, there are two on Garfield Ave. across from each other (the result of a divorce settlement). Some specialize in Baja-style fish tacos. Others offer a standard menu of tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Still others focus on soups and stews. Head to La Estrella #2 on Fair Oaks Ave for an OG taco — two small corn or flour tortillas topped with your choice of eight fillings (al pastor, carnitas, asada, cabeza, buche, etc.) and finished with chopped white onions and cilantro — that costs a mere $1.75. With its prime location just north of the 210 Freeway, this La Estrella is the busiest of the local three. A straight-up, no-nonsense taco stand, it stays open until 2 a.m. and has ample parking in back. There's no indoor seating but the patio has four small tables. In addition to the standard menu options, you might notice something called ""fried guts,"" chopped innards of indeterminate provenance. If you've got 'em, get 'em.

This location of growing grocery chain Vallarta Supermarkets supplanted a desultory Von's, expanding the space and giving it a much needed facelift. The only drawback is the manic parking lot. You may be familiar with the Vallarta brand but this location is exceptional. The only comparison is the enormous Whole Foods on Arroyo Parkway, a mile and a half south, except Vallarta has a larger and better selection of fresh produce and far lower prices. Enter at the north end of the store and you'll find yourself at a sushi bar and taqueria. (Tortillas are made in-house, in an impressive glassed-in tortilleria on the other side of the store.) In addition to the usual choices (asada, carnitas, al pastor, pollo, lengua, cabeza), which are all reliably tasty, Vallarta offers occasional variations. You might find tacos made with super-hot Ghost Pepper salsa or ""quesa tacos,"" which have a layer of cheese lining the tortilla. Counter service can be slow but once you have your plate, make a pit stop at the generous salsa and condiment bar then head to the small dining area or the outdoor tables. As a bonus, you'll find an eclectic assortment of fresh ceviches, a juice bar, a fully appointed salad bar, a steam table of hot entrees and an assortment of housemade tamales. 
655 N. Fair Oaks Ave., Pasadena. 626-204-6960
Credit cards accepted. Alcohol available for purchase. El Taquito Mexicano
Reliable and unpretentious, El Taquito Mexicano serves straightforward tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Despite its name, they don't offer taquitos but they do make sopes, huaraches and nachos. At this small but popular spot, most of the action happens at the back counter where a long, glassed-in steam table allows you to watch as your taco is assembled. El Taquito Mexicano does a brisk weekday lunch business. Although the line sometimes stretches to the door, the service is swift and friendly. I prefer the chicken, carnitas and al pastor tacos but you have several options including cabeza and lengua. Served on paper plates, these small, street-style tacos cost $2 or less.

Street Vendors
On Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, from approximately 6 to 10 p.m., an entrepreneurial chef sometimes slings tacos, burritos and burgers out of his driveway. The offerings vary from week to week but carne asada and grilled chicken are fixtures and the excellent tacos cost a mere $1. I've even seen a cactus paddle on the grill for nopales, if you're looking for a plant-based option. Still, most patrons of this bootleg operation come for the burger, which features a grilled and quartered hotdog piled onto the patty. Given its popularity (expect a wait) and presumed lack of permitting and inspection, I'm only going to say that the operation is near Orange Grove Blvd.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Frier Mccollister,4QNANYOTDJEVXK4TINYY4CMXVU,1
2020-01-26T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/26/kobe-bryant-death-why-it-hurts-so-much.php,I Am Straight Up In Tears Right Now.' Why Kobe Bryant's Death Hurts So Much: LAist,"My first instinct is anger and denial; legends never die. But I am straight up in tears right now as I write this, so it must be real. Kobe Bean Bryant died in a helicopter crash with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, early Sunday morning in the fog covered hills of Calabasas. And Los Angeles will never be the same.
It's illogical, man. I don't know why I'm crying. But it also makes sense that the man who constantly wowed us with his feats, would end up leaving us in disbelief once more. And Gianna, that hurts that much more. She was his legacy more than any of the trophies and records.
I'm shook.
As a former employee of the Lakers TV station, I've had the rare privilege of being in the same rooms as Kobe. I saw up close his charisma and death stare. I've been thrilled when he agreed to give us a few minutes of his time. I've been frustrated when he cancelled last minute or was rude about it. But mostly, I've been in absolute awe of him and inspired by him. So much so that I legit thought he was immortal, the same way I think my father and mother are.
I guess that's what it is. That's what's destroying my reality. When Nipsey Hussle died, it broke me but it was also like, ""yeah that makes sense."" It was like me dying, you know? It's a bit hard to explain that feeling unless you grew up in places like we did. None of us grows up feeling immortal.
But Kobe was hope, man. When he shot those four-air balls, as a teenage wunderkind, me and my brother were still like, ""give the ball to Kobe."" Even as he failed, we still believed he would bring us a dynasty. And he did. Boy did we need it.
Kobe was a complicated person. He was a ruthless competitor and could be a selfish teammate. And the rape allegations will forever mar his career. But for many of us, he represented the possibility that we - even in our flaws - could be excellent. In 2000, after the Lakers won their first title in the Kobe Bryant era, I went outside and laid out in the back of my dad's pick up and stared up at the sky. I couldn't believe it. The streets of Southeast Los Angeles were bursting with the sounds of celebrations: car horns, fireworks, gunshots and, I swear, the sound of my enormous smile. High school sucked and we didn't have almost anything, but we had the title and we had Kobe.
He did that over and over again. Kobe Bryant gave us something special even when we had nothing else to cheer for in our lives. And through his legendary determination and hard work, gave us a road map to getting our own personal victories. A road map, no doubt his own daughter Gianna Maria Onore was following in her own right.
In a career spanning two decades all in Los Angeles purple and gold, Kobe Bryant went on to bring his fans five NBA titles, a victory over the hated Celtics in a Game 7, 18 all-star selections, an MVP award, 33,643 points, 20 seasons of hope, even an Oscar trophy and ... there has to be more, right?

What's Next?: LAist","Developers, landlords, Facebook, construction unions, the state Chamber of Commerce, Realtors, environmental groups and even the AARP wanted to see the bill pass. So did big city mayors including San Francisco's London Breed and San Jose's Sam Liccardo. Not to mention Sen. Toni Atkins, Democratic leader of the state Senate, who typically has a pretty big say in which bills make it out of her chamber.
Nonetheless Senate Bill 50, a measure that would have forced cities to allow more mid-rise apartment buildings around public transit and next to some single-family homes, failed to get enough votes in the California Legislature to survive in 2020 before time ran out.
The question now is how Gov. Gavin Newsom plans to meet one of his signature campaign goals: building millions of new homes. And if cities, anti-gentrification activists and suburban homeowners could stymie the assortment of powerful interests backing that bill, what pro-development policy options are left?
""California's housing affordability crisis demands our state pass a historic housing production bill,"" Newsom said in a statement shortly after the bill was voted down by Democratic and Republican lawmakers.
So what does that housing production bill actually look like?
Here are some options. The governor may not like many of them.
Put Zoning Changes In A Bill Package — With Redevelopment
The governor set a campaign goal of 3.5 million new housing units by 2025 to help relieve the state's crippling affordability crisis. In his first year in office, California was on pace to permit roughly 120,000 units — nowhere near Newsom's audacious rate or what experts say is needed to offset rising rents and home prices (final numbers for 2019 are expected soon).
After intervening to help pass a tenant protection bill last year, Newsom vowed to focus on housing production in 2020 — legislation that would make it easier for developers to create new market-rate and low-income housing.
Despite never receiving the governor's explicit endorsement, backers of the housing-near-transit bill presumed it would serve as the de facto legislative vehicle for the governor's ambitions.
A UCLA analysis found that cities across California would likely have to dramatically ""upzone"" — allow much denser development where it is legally prohibited now —for Newsom to come close to 3.5 million new homes. That's exactly what SB 50 attempted to do.
""A housing production agenda without zoning reform is incomplete,"" said Sen. Scott Wiener, the San Francisco Democrat who authored the bill. ""Restrictive zoning puts a mathematical cap on the new housing you can build.""
In order to lift that cap, upzoning may now have to be combined with a sweetener for cities who resent the state encroaching on local control over housing decisions. That sweetener could be redevelopment — a state program that cities used and misused to fund affordable housing before former Gov. Jerry Brown dissolved the program nearly a decade ago.
Cities have desperately clamored for that lost revenue ever since.
""A hard production bill can pass the Legislature, and if you pair it with funding it makes it even much less challenging,"" said Wiener. ""I would love to see major zoning reform paired with SB 795,"" a bill from San Jose Democratic Sen. Jim Beall that attempts to revive redevelopment.
But redevelopment is the kind of sweetener that could nauseate Newsom. The governor vetoed Beall's redevelopment bill last year, and is loathe to commit the state to the billions in ongoing spending it would entail.
Wiener also hinted that any production bill would benefit from being included in a broader package of other housing bills — some serving tenant and anti-gentrification groups, others serving cities. Ironically, Newsom's housing achievements last year may have doomed SB 50 in 2020.
""The idea was to pair SB 50 with a renter protection bill and with a funding bill and the (accessory dwelling unit) bills...and have a real package,"" said Wiener. ""Once the renter protection bill passed without SB 50...the leverage diminished significantly.""
Wait For Your New Housing Sticks And Carrots To Kick In
On and off the record, Newsom administration officials asked about their housing plans invariably offer up some version of the following: Just wait until the stuff we've already done starts kicking in.
They're referring mostly to administrative efforts — some of which happened under the Jerry Brown administration — to force cities to allow more housing. Newsom's housing department has tripled the number of units Southern California have to plan for. Huge new housing quotas are on the horizon for the Bay Area.
""Since we are already getting much larger numbers, our cities are going to have to contemplate greater density and greater height anyway just to comply with these laws,"" said Jason Rhine, assistant legislative director for the League of Cities, which opposed Wiener's bill. ""A lot of the objectives of SB 50 will be realized just based on existing law.""
But there are legitimate questions about whether new state penalties will effectively coerce California cities, which have a long history of flouting state housing law.
Newsom's original proposal to withhold gas tax revenue from cities stubbornly failing to meet their state-imposed housing goals failed to garner much support. A replacement scheme that allows a judge to fine non-compliant cities has yet to be tested.
Reform The California Environmental Quality Act
Good luck. If Wiener's bill was comparable to climbing Half Dome, so-called CEQA reform would equate to ascending the Himalayas.
His bill was the rare piece of housing legislation that united developers, unionized labor and most environmental groups.
Those groups — major sources of campaign donations for Democratic lawmakers would go to war against each other over changing the California Environmental Quality Act. Developers have long contended the act is a burdensome tool that labor and neighborhood groups use to block and delay new developments, adding unnecessary costs to projects.
""It is difficult,"" said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the California Building Industry Association, the lobbying group for developers in the Capitol. ""If labor and the environmental community and trial lawyers and local governments are opposed to it, it's very difficult to get it passed.""
Newsom tried to broker a deal between developers and labor to modify the law last year, to no avail. And reports of ongoing tension between construction workers' unions and the Newsom administration make the prospects of compromise increasingly remote.
The Legislature isn't yet considering any proposal to seriously alter the act.
Cut Impact Fees
Another cost that developers constantly say inhibits new housing from being built? Fees that local governments impose on new developments for parks, schools and other infrastructure to serve a new development's residents.
Here Newsom may find some wiggle room. Cities could be receptive to lowering how much they're allowed to charge as long as they get that revenue from another source.
""There's probably no avoiding a conversation about impact fees,"" said Rhine, the League of Cities' lobbyist. ""We are open to finding new ways of funding it. We just have to make sure we're made whole. You can't build a house without sewer and infrastructure and roads.""
There may be a legislative vehicle for Newsom to push here — a bill from Concord Democratic Assemblyman Timothy Grayson to bring more transparency to how much cities charge per new unit of housing. Supporters want to expand the bill to have it cap how much cities can charge.
Even so, the impact such a cap would make on California's housing shortage falls far short of more sweeping options.
""We strongly support that bill,"" said Louis Mirante, legislative director for California ""Yes in My Backyard"", which sponsored the defeated Wiener bill. ""But I want to be clear that nothing in the Legislature responds to the housing crisis with the proportionality of SB 50.""","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Matt Levin | Calmatters,G77TD5MLBRCYFEBJJUIKQELCWY,1

The filing, made in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, came as the religious group is holding its ""Holy Supper"" event at the Pomona Fairplex, attended by thousands.
It also comes more than eight months since Garcia, the Mexico-based megachurch's religious leader, was arrested in Los Angeles on dozens of felony child rape and human trafficking charges. He has been held without bail in downtown L.A.'s Men's Central Jail since then, after the court refused to grant bail citing him as a high-flight risk.
The lawsuit filed by Sochil Martin, a former Luz Del Mundo member, marks the first time a former La Luz Del Mundo church member has spoken openly about abuse allegations. Martin's lawyers held a news conference Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles to detail her claims against the religious organization, Garcia and other top leaders of the organization.
The 34-year-old woman says she grew up deep in La Luz Del Mundo, primarily attending the flagship temple in East L.A.
Martin says she was groomed as a child, beaten, forced to work for no pay for the church's communications department, and raped hundreds of times over two decades by Apostle Naason Joaquin Garcia and his father, Samuel Joaquin Flores. Martin's complaint alleges a ring of child sexual slavery and financial manipulation within the church and points fingers at Naason Joaquin Garcia's family members and La Luz Del Mundo bishops, many of whom are based in Southern California.
""For nearly 22 years, I was made to work for, travel for, lie for and give my body to an organization who saw me as nothing more than a source of profit and sexual pleasure,"" Martin told reporters gathered at the offices of Greenberg Gross in downtown Los Angeles Thursday. ""Hundreds, if not thousands of other children before me and after me suffered the same fate.""
Church officials rejected Martin's account Thursday morning.
""I think it's just a ploy for attention,"" said Jack Freeman, La Luz Del Mundo's U.S. spokesman and minister of its temple in Redlands. ""It's hatred being manifested towards the Church to disrupt our biggest and holiest event.""
Freeman told LAist he hadn't read the complaint, but confirmed that Martin was a former church member who had once worked for La Luz Del Mundo's communications arm, Berea International USA. WHAT IS LA LUZ DEL MUNDO?
La Luz Del Mundo (full name ""Church of the Living God, Pillar and Ground of the Truth, The Light of the World"") was founded in Guadalajara in the 1920s by Naason Joaquin Garcia's grandfather Eusebio Joaquín González, the church's first self-proclaimed apostle.
La Luz Del Mundo is Mexico's second-largest religious movement, after the Catholic Church. It's a Protestant Christian religious movement that considers itself a restoration of early Christian church.
The Light of The World reports 1,500 temples in 58 countries and between 1 and 5 million members worldwide.
It has a big presence in California, with more than 50 temples, including churches in East L.A. and Pasadena. Joaquin Garcia's father, Samuel Joaquin Flores, led the church from 1964 until 2014.He was the subject of sexual abuse allegations in 1997, but never faced criminal charges.
La Luz traditions are unfamiliar to many in the U.S. Churches offer three prayer services each day. Male and female worshippers sit on opposite sides of churches. Women wear long skirts and cover their heads with lace veils. Church members aren't supposed to drink, smoke or gamble. The church does not celebrate Christmas or Easter.
As a minority religion in heavily Catholic Mexico, La Luz Del Mundo members have faced some marginalization and persecution. WHAT IS THE HOLY SUPPER?
This event is the U.S. twist on the group's annual Santa Cena gathering at the church's historic headquarters in Guadalajara — which draws hundreds of thousands of the church's millions of members every August in honor of the founding apostle's birthday.
It's a sacred rite and ritual for Luz Del Mundo members. Several cups filled with wine (or grape juice) are shared among their thousands of members.
This U.S. version was first held here in 2018, to signal the church's growing role in the U.S. under Naason Joaquin Garcia's leadership.
The ritual itself is scheduled to take place Friday evening, in part commemorating the former apostle Samuel Joaquin Flores' birthday.
""It's a moment of spiritual renewal where we are able to break bread, drink wine and regain our connection with God and Jesus Christ,"" said Genesis Coronado, a spokesperson providing a tour of the Pomona Fairplex. ""As humans, we have moments of sin, and this event allows us to reconcile with God.""
Church officials estimated more than 10,000 members showed up to celebrate in Pomona. There are five more sites around the country, including San Diego, Phoenix, Chicago, Dallas, and Wanshington D.C. NEW ALLEGATIONS FROM 'THE INNER-CIRCLE'
Sochil Martin is stepping forward and alleging years of abuse and manipulation growing up deep inside the religious group's flagship church in East L.A,, where the jailed church leader and self-proclaimed ""Apostle"" of the religious movement was once a pastor.
In her civil complaint, Martin says she was trafficked throughout the U.S. and Mexico, beaten and raped dozens of times and even forced to have sex with children — all to satisfy the desires of ""the two Apostles,"" Naason Joaquin Garcia, and his father Samuel Joaquin Flores.
Martin also claims that since age 16, La Luz Del Mundo's senior leaders forced her to do more than 30,000 hours of unpaid work for the church's communications arm, International Berea USA. which is run out of East L.A. and was established by Naason Joaquin Garcia in 2009.
Martin alleges church leaders used their positions of power to benefit from her trafficking and unpaid labor. She named 12 additional people in the lawsuit, including several bishops in La Luz Del Mundo, some of Martin's former bosses at the Church's communications department and Naason Joaquin Garcia's family members. She alleges a widespread culture of coercion and control inside the organization. Martin says countless members have been forced to work for LDM. The complaint claims most of the employees at Berea International were unpaid.
""For far too many La Luz Del Mundo members, everything they have is taken by LLDM. Every dollar they make goes to La Luz Del Mundo because they truly believe their money will be used to do the work of God on Earth,"" Martin said. ""But all the hard-earned money goes to making Naason and his enablers rich.""
Martin claims, on one occasion, LDM members in Southern California were encouraged to donate gold jewelry and heirlooms to the Apostle, which were melted down and used to paint the molding on his new home in Los Angeles.
She says members are pressured to give whatever they have to the Church, including homes, which are then either used by the Apostle's family or rented out to other LDM members for revenue.
""As thousands gather to celebrate the Holy Supper, Naason's followers will call me a liar and coerce members into giving their last pennies into helping Naason fight me and people like me,"" Martin said.
Martin says cash donated at La Luz del Mundo's temples feeds Naason Joaquin Garcia's lavish lifestyle. According to the complaint, Naason Joaquin Garcia owns two private ranches in Redlands and South Texas, which house exotic animals and vintage cars.
Sochil left the Church in 2016. Since 2018, She's been working with authorities to help investigate and prosecute La Luz Del Mundo's leaders.
WHAT'S HAPPENED IN COURT SO FAR?
Naason Joaquin Garcia and several co-conspirators were arrested last June and charged with dozens of felonies in a case filed by California Department of Justice. Garcia was first held on record high bail in L.A. county, and now without bail oncharges involve three girls and one young woman in L.A. county in recent years. Garcia had denied the charges.
The case has been dragging in the pre-trial phase since Naason Joaquin Garcia's dramatic arrest at LAX, at least in part because the child victims in the case were guaranteed anonymity when they reported alleged abuse to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office. But the criminal case filed today is the first where a former member of the church is publicly accusing La Luz Del Mundo and its leadership of manipulation and sex abuse. Sochil's attorneys, from Greenberg Gross and Jeff Anderson & Associates, said they hoped more victims will come forward.
Church officials and active members maintain the innocence and righteousness of their leader and Apostle. Spokesman Jack Freeman says despite the new allegations, the Holy Supper is going on as planned and has already resulted in hundreds of baptisms around the U.S.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Aaron Schrank,ZQFHDJPYRZFHJD7F5TDY2ERIKA,1
2020-01-13T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/13/how-to-vote-presidential-primary-california.php,The Biggest Mistake California Voters Are Making Right Now (And How To Avoid It): LAist,"If you're confused about how to vote in California's presidential primary, you're in good company with Susan Sarandon.
At the beginning of January, the ""Thelma and Louise"" actress and Sanders enthusiast issued a public service announcement on Twitter: ""California voters: make sure to switch from independent to democrat (sic) in order to vote for ⁦@BernieSanders.""
Just one problem: She's wrong. Political independents (known in California election parlance as ""no party preference"" voters) do not need to switch parties to vote in the Democratic presidential primary — the just need to request a Democratic ballot first.
Technically, Sarandon was retweeting the account @TimOnTheTractor — but Tim (presumably) doesn't have an Academy Award. He also doesn't have 653,000 Twitter followers to misinform. To be fair, the minutiae of California election law is really confusing! And Sarandon is hardly alone. Election day in California is March 3, but already social media has become a bipartisan chorus of wrongness about the what, how and why of the state's presidential primary.
If you're unsure about how to get the ballot you want, why things here are so complicated or what presidential primaries are all about, here are four things to know before you vote:
THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WILL NOT USE THE FAMILIAR ""TOP TWO"" BALLOT
California voters can be forgiven for assuming that political party registration doesn't really matter.
In 2010 voters backed a measure to create the state's nonpartisan ""top two"" election system, in which all primary voters fill out a ballot with every candidate on it — regardless of either the voter's or the candidate's political party. The top two winners then move on to the general election ballot — even if they're both from the same party.
In races for state legislative and congressional seats, the top two method will still reign on the 2020 ballot.
But when you vote in the presidential primary, it's back to the old partisan system: Democrats on the Democratic ballot, Republicans on the Republican ballot, and so on.
So while voting in California usually goes like this under the top two: In the presidential primary, it looks a little more like this: NO PARTY PREFERENCE VOTERS: PAY ATTENTION!
Registered Democrats, Republicans, Greens, Libertarians and other party members, rest assured. You are guaranteed a primary ballot with all of your party's presidential contenders on it.
But voters who don't belong to a political party — the fastest growing voting block in the state — will have to navigate a more daunting set of obstacles to cast a presidential primary vote.
Some parties have ""members only"" policies:
The Republican Party
The Green Party
The Peace and Freedom Party
If you want to vote in one of these three primaries, you'll have to join that party. You can't do it as a member of any other party, or even as a ""no party preference"" independent. No exceptions.
The following three parties do allow political independents to cast ballots in their presidential primaries:
The Democratic Party
The Libertarian Party
The American Independent Party (which is the party's name and not to be confused with being a party-less political independent)
But — and this is an important caveat — these voters do have to specifically request the ballot they want.
For those who vote in person, this is a cinch. Just go into your polling place when it's time to vote and ask. But independents who vote by mail need to let your county know which ballot they want ahead of time.
Maybe you received a postcard that looks like this: If so, and you filled it out and mailed it back, you should be all set. If you missed the deadline or lost the card, and you're not going to vote in person, email or call your county registrar's office and let them know which ballot you want. L.A. County voters:

""No party preference"" is the designation for voters who do not affiliate with a party. Yes, it's very confusing. Want to know more? Our friends at the L.A. Times took a hard look at this a few years ago>>) L.A. AND ORANGE COUNTIES ARE AMONG 15 DOING THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY
If you live in one of the counties highlighted below, voting might look a little different this year. In 2016, California passed the ""Voter Choice Act,"" a law aimed at modernizing the state's election system, such that:
Every registered voter gets a ballot in the mail
Voters are no longer required to go to a specific polling place, but can vote at any number of voting centers or drop-off points
Voters can cast their ballots in person beginning 11 days before, and up to and including, Election Day
In 2018, five counties (Madera, Napa, Nevada, Sacramento, and San Mateo) rolled out the new system. This year, 10 more will join their ranks, including L.A. and Orange counties. That's fifteen counties in all containing 49% of the state population.
This is key for ""no party preference"" voters living in these counties who may not get the ballot they want in the mail. See the previous section for details.
DELEGATE MATH CAN BE COMPLICATED
In state legislative races, the electoral calculations are straightforward: The two candidates who earned the most votes, regardless of party, move on to the final voting round in November.
But the math is trickier in the presidential primary: citizen votes are used to select party convention delegates, who then select the party's nominee for the White House.
Let's focus on the Democratic contest, which is bound to be the most interesting one. Nationwide there will be 4,532 Democratic delegates, 495 come from California.
In the Golden State, presidential hopefuls can earn delegates three ways:
By winning a large share of the statewide vote.
By winning a large share of the vote in any one of the state's 53 congressional districts.
By successfully schmoozing party leaders.
The 144 statewide delegates are awarded in proportion to a candidate's performance across the state — up to a point. To take a recent polling average average from FiveThirtyEight as a hypothetical election result, if Joe Biden wins 23% of the California vote, he would win the support of at least 23% of those statewide delegates.
Why ""at least""? Party rules require candidates to demonstrate a baseline level of electoral viability: they only earn delegates if they win at least 15% of the vote.
Only three candidates exceed that threshold in the polls: Biden with 23%, Sen. Bernie Sanders with 22% and Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 17%. By that math, Biden would get 36% of the delegates because he earned 36% of the primary vote split just among the candidates who exceeded the benchmark. Another 272 delegates are awarded by congressional district. That gives candidates who have strong support in a particular region of the state an opportunity to earn delegates even if they don't perform well overall.
But not all districts are created equal. The Democratic Party assigns between 4 and 7 delegates to each district depending on the number of Democratic voters who live and vote there. Thus, San Francisco gets 7, while the state's rural, conservative northeastern district gets 4.
For these delegates, the proportional logic is the same but at a smaller scale: delegates are divvied up among candidates who earn more than 15% of the vote in each district.
The last 79 delegates are composed of the party elite — people like Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state's sitting members of Congress, the top members of the state party. They automatically get a spot at the convention. They're also ""superdelegates,"" meaning they can vote for whomever they want.
But superdelegates don't have as much power as they used to, thanks to a post-2016 change in the party rules designed to wrest some control from the party establishment. When regular delegates first vote for the nominee at their convention in Milwaukee next July, super-delegates will have to sit out the vote. It's only if a candidate doesn't win a majority of delegate votes outright in the first round do the superdelegates then get to weigh in.

2020-01-29T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/29/local_olive_oil_los_angeles_southern_california_evoo_tasting_rooms_where_to_find_it.php,"Local Olive Oil 101: Where To Find It, How To Judge It And What To Know : LAist","When the Temecula Olive Oil Company opened in 2001, olive oil produced in California was an agricultural oddball. Small producers, concentrated in Northern California's wine country, had resurrected a long-dead local industry and created what seemed, at best, like a niche product. The Old World understood olive oil — they'd been making it for thousands of years — so how could California's oils rival anything from Italy or Spain? ""It was like the California wine business was back in the '60s,"" says Thom Curry, who co-founded the company along with his wife, Nancy, and their neighbor Catherine Demuth-Pepe. ""There was still wine production in California back then but if you wanted good stuff, it had to come from Europe."" Over the last few decades, the Golden State's olive oil industry has followed in the wine industry's footsteps, growing exponentially and creating oils that hold their own against the best Europe has to offer.
Most of the world's olives come from abroad. Spain, Italy and Greece are the big three. According to Shirley Li, assistant director of the UC Davis Olive Center, imported olive oil makes up around 95% of total consumption in the United States. Domestically produced olive oil constitutes the remaining 5 to 7% — and 99% of that comes from California. ""Just a decade ago, we were under 1%,"" says Patricia Darragh, executive director of the California Olive Oil Council. California olive oil production is small but mighty. While our state can't match the output of Europe's traditional production centers, what we do churn out is top notch.
""When we started, it used to be, 'California makes olive oil?'"", says Curry, who operates olive groves throughout Southern California. ""Now, the expectation for California olive oil is that it will be great stuff.""
For peak flavor, olive oil should be consumed fresh (it's a fruit juice, after all) and buying local can help ensure a fresh product. Here's a crash course to help you find the ideal bottle of California olive oil, whether you're at your local grocery store or visiting a tasting room. Back From The Dead
California olive oil got its start in the late 1700s with Spanish missionaries. They used the oil for sacraments and eventually started trading it. The industry grew steadily until the early 1900s, when the introduction of inexpensive vegetable oils, such as cottonseed, coupled with cheaper imports from Europe, decimated California olive oil production. Most farmers switched to growing table olives or abandoned their groves.
Olive trees are hardy. They don't mind heat and they grow well in less-than-stellar soil. They can also live for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.
In the mid-1980s, when Sonoma and Napa wineries were coming into their own, many vintners traveled to Europe and noticed how those wineries often cultivated olive trees. They came home and planted new groves or rediscovered abandoned ones, restarting California's moribund olive oil industry.
It was around this time that olive oil saw a spike in popularity in the U.S. It was praised for its health benefits — rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, olive oil can potentially help lower a person's risk of heart disease — but more than that, it became a statement of culinary sophistication. Forget bland, basic Crisco. Here was a finely crafted product with a complicated flavor profile and a rich history. If it could help you live a little longer, all the better. What Even Is Extra Virgin Olive Oil?
With olive oil, it all comes down to purity. To help remove flaws or impurities, some oils are treated or refined with chemicals or heat processes. If you see a ""regular"" or ""pure"" olive oil at the market, it likely features a blend of refined and unrefined, cold-pressed olive oils.
Extra virgin oil, in contrast, comes straight from the olive and is extruded using mechanical means, like cold pressing, that don't alter the oil in any way. Extra virgin olive oil (known as EVOO thanks to Rachel Ray) is the first pressing of olive oil. It's the purest stuff you can get. It features a robust, sometimes spicy flavor and phenolic compounds (which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits) in higher concentrations than refined oils.
To be considered a true EVOO, the oil must be produced without chemical or heat treatments. Even then, it doesn't stay pure forever. Olive oil is best consumed within 18 months of its harvest date, or six months after the bottle is opened. Beyond that, it begins to go rancid. Reputable EVOOs will include a bottling or harvest date on the bottle, usually on the label. Determining what is (and isn't) ""extra virgin"" is headache-inducing.
The United States Department of Agriculture relies on a set of standards similar to those used by the International Olive Council, which require chemical analysis to determine the levels of fatty oleic acid and polyphenols along with sensory testing to determine quality. But the USDA's standards are voluntary and sometimes, imported olive oils aren't extra virgin at all.
In 2010, the Olive Center released a limited study that tested samples of imported olive oils sold in California supermarkets. The study noted that 69% of the imported olive oil samples labeled ""extra virgin"" did not meet international standards.
""They may have been extra virgin when they were produced,"" says Li, but during transportation and storage, the oils could have been exposed to temperature or light conditions that caused degradation. (The Olive Center released a follow-up study in 2011. It had similar findings.)
That's why the California Olive Oil Council, a trade group, created its own certification process for California olive oils. The COOC's standards are stricter than USDA's, so this label on a bottle is a good sign but, again, it's voluntary and only regulates oils grown in California. Paul Vossen has spent nearly four decades as a University of California agricultural extension agent, helping olive growers throughout the state. ""Generally speaking, if you buy a California olive oil, you're pretty much assured that you're going to get a high quality oil,"" he says.
Because California's standards are so high, Vossen thinks you shouldn't focus too much on EVOO.
Curry agrees. A strict EVOO standard safeguards quality and helps protect consumers but it shouldn't be the ultimate measure of what makes a good olive oil.
""It's a marketing term. What we try to focus on with consumer education is freshness. Olive oil is fruit juice. It's not meant to age,"" Curry says.
After freshness, he thinks the most important benchmark for an olive oil is taste
""Olives have terroir just like wine grapes do,"" says Zach Thorp, owner of LOT22 Olive Oil Co., which produces a range of olive oils, including EVOO and flavored oils blended with citrus for UC Riverside's University Citrus Variety Collection. ""This means that they can have a different flavor profile or taste depending on where they are grown."" How Should Olive Oil Taste?
Like wine or beer, olive oil exists on a spectrum. A sharp, bitter flavor is just a baseline. ""It should be herbaceous, spicy, a little bit of black pepper, maybe a mint flavor, too,"" Vosser says.
Although the milling process is rigid — olives must be milled within 24 hours of harvesting to protect oil quality and prevent fermentation — the resulting oils will taste different depending on when they are harvested.
In California, the harvest season usually runs from November to December. Green olives, which haven't ripened, are harvested earlier. As they ripen, they change from green to black. Olives harvested later in the season will have begun the ripening process, altering their flavor profile. Oils made from greener olives will have a vibrant punch as well as a green aroma and flavor. (Think grass or green apples.) When tasting one of these pungent, spicy oils, you might feel a tickle in your throat and an urge to cough. That's a good sign. Aficionados often rate an EVOO as a one-, two- or three-cough oil. However, oils made from riper olives (olives that have started to darken) will be smoother and they'll feature a nutty, buttery flavor. This is where your palate comes into play. Some people like a robust oil, others favor something milder.
From weather to where the olives are grown, other factors can also impact taste, which is why trying different oils is so important. ""It's not a one-size-fits-all thing,"" Curry says. When you're looking for oil, he recommends using your preferences in coffee as a barometer. ""If you like coffee sweeter, with cream and sugar, then you might like something buttery, a little more late harvest. If you like black coffee, then you'll like something with green olives that's bitter and pungent.""
Philip Asquith, master miller and CEO of Ojai Olive Oil, explains that when EVOO degrades, it doesn't become unusable, it just loses its flavor.
""It's not like fruit going bad where all of a sudden it's rotten. But it becomes flat and bland. We, as a country, have gotten used to olive oil tasting bland, so when you taste a good, fully intact oil, it might be too much at first,"" he says.
Sampling different oils to figure out your tastes is key. But where and how do you do that?
Start with your local farmers market or find an olive oil tasting room. You'll have a chance to ask questions and learn more about a local oil producer. Plus, you can explore a range of different oils. Nathan Mardigian of Nuvo Olive Oil, which grows its olives near Lake Oroville in Northern California and has a Long Beach tasting room in that you can visit by appointment, notes that by sampling different oils, you'll educate yourself and refine your palate. ""Smell the oil, take a sip and taste it,"" he says. ""Your palate will speak volumes as to the quality of the food that you're putting in your body.""
Inspect The Bottle
If you want to grab a top notch olive oil, look for a seal from the COOC or a comparable international group like the Extra Virgin Alliance (EVA) or the Australian Olive Association (AOA). It's a lot of acronyms but that should ensure that your EVOO is actually EVOO.
Avoid plastic containers, which can degrade the oil. Opt for tins or tinted glass. The enemies of olive oil are oxygen, heat and light so containers should be dark. ""It doesn't take much to lower an oil's quality,"" Asquith says. Look for a harvest date on the bottle. Sealed and properly stored EVOO is best used within 18 months of the harvest. Some oils are stamped with an expiration date of two to three years. Ignore that and stick with the harvest date.
After you find a bottle you like, keep it in a cool, dark place and use it quickly. Even if you cook with it every day, don't leave it near your stovetop.
Finding the perfect olive oil for your taste takes time. California is an ideal place to experiment and shopping locally makes it easier to find fresh oils.
""Invest in local farmers,"" Thorp says. ""They're working hard to bring you the best and the likeliness of getting something fresh locally is higher — it doesn't have to go on a plane or boat to get to you.""
The right bottle of olive oil is out there. Thankfully, you shouldn't have to go too far to track it down. A Few Localish Olive Oil Producers

L.A. County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced that her office has filed new rape and sexual assault charges against Weinstein.
Weinstein, 67, is charged with raping one woman and sexually assaulting another during a two-day period in 2013, Lacey said. Neither woman was identified in a statement from Lacey's office.
Specifically, Weinstein is charged with forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force and sexual battery by restraint.
""We believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them,"" Lacey said in a statement. ""I want to commend the victims who have come forward and bravely recounted what happened to them.""
The DA said at a news conference that ""it was very challenging to get some victims to open up,"" adding that her office has been working on the case ""quite diligently in the past couple years.""
On Feb. 18, 2013, Weinstein allegedly went to a hotel and raped a woman after pushing his way inside her room, according to the statement from Lacey's office.
It said Weinstein is accused of sexually assaulting a woman the next evening at a hotel suite in Beverly Hills.
The statement said the former producer will face up to 28 years in prison if convicted of all charges.
The DA's office said Weinstein will be arraigned at a later date. Lacey said she doesn't want to interfere with the New York trial.
These are the first charges stemming from the work of a task force Lacey launched in 2017 to investigate sexual abuse allegations against high-profile figures in the entertainment industry.
The DA's office had looked into accusations against Weinstein from eight alleged victims of sexual battery or assault. Four were forwarded by the LAPD and four by Beverly Hills police.
In the New York case, Weinstein is charged with several counts of rape and sexual assault based on the accusations of Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant for his company, and a second unidentified woman. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday, Jan. 7.
He has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyers have argued that most of the encounters were consensual.
Weinstein's lawyer in Los Angeles, Blair Berk, and his publicist Juda Engelmayer were not immediately available for comment.
In an interview with the New York Post last month, Weinstein called himself ""the forgotten man"" and talked about how many women he helped during his career. In response, nearly two dozen of his accusers, including Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan, sent a statement to the Los Angeles Times denouncing Weinstein as ""an unrepentant abuser,"" saying, ""we refuse to let this predator rewrite his legacy of abuse.""
The producer behind such Oscar-winning hits as ""Shakespeare in Love,"" ""Chicago"" and ""The King's Speech,"" Weinstein was fired from the Weinstein Co. in October 2017 after dozens of women accused him of sexual misconduct. The firm filed for bankruptcy in March 2018.
More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual battery and/or assault over the past couple of years.
Last month, Weinstein, several of his accusers and the Weinstein Co.'s former board reached a tentative $47 million settlement of a lawsuit against him. If a judge approves the deal, $25 million of the amount will go to the accusers.
Weinstein is still facing a number of other civil lawsuits over alleged sexual misconduct.

An airline passenger arrived at the Tom Bradley International Terminal on Jan. 12 while infectious, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health.
The person visited a CVS Pharmacy on San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood, and returned again on Jan. 18, officials said in a news release, which also included the following timeframes:
Jan. 12: LAX international terminal and baggage claim — 1:45 to 5 p.m.
Jan. 13: CVS Pharmacy, 11941 San Vincente Blvd. — 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
Jan. 18: CVS Pharmacy, 11941 San Vincente Blvd. — 8:45 a.m. to 11 a.m.
Health officials caution that anyone who was present at those locations at those times and either is unvaccinated or unsure of vaccination status could be at risk of contracting the highly infectious virus. That risk is of particularly high concern if the person is pregnant, an infant or someone whose immune system is weakened. Authorities are urging anyone meeting those criteria to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible.
Anyone exposed should continue to check themselves for signs of infection — which includes fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash — from seven to 21 days after exposure.
Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world, with about 90% of unvaccinated individuals exposed to it falling ill one to three weeks later, health officials said.
Authorities say there were 20 measles cases among L.A. County residents last year and 14 cases among non-residents who traveled through the county. That was enough to declare an outbreak last year. At least three infected people traveled through LAX last year.
That does not include Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments that reported cases.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Laist Staff,LJ4ZP5J3XBHZBPKEA6RYKJ23GU,1

The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office has yet to officially identify the victims, but family members, friends, schools and other entities have been naming them and sharing their stories.
The victims include Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, two of her teammates on the basketball team Bryant coached, some of those girls' parents and the helicopter pilot. Here's what we're learning about them. Bryant was traveling with his daughter, Gianna, and seven other people, reportedly en route to his Mamba Sports Academy facility in Thousand Oaks.
The basketball legend played for the Los Angeles Lakers his entire career, leading to five NBA championships, 18 all-star selections, and a league MVP award over 20 years.
As news of his death spread, tributes poured in, including from our own Erick Galindo, who wrote about why Bryant's death hurts so much for Angelenos and Lakers fans.
Bryant's last tweet and Instagram post were congratulatory messages to Lakers star LeBron James, who surpassed Bryant for third place on the NBA's all-time scoring list during the Lakers' 108-91 loss to the 76ers on Saturday. In addition to Gianna, Bryant and his wife, Vanessa, have three daughters — Natalia, Bianka and Capri, who was born last June. Bryant's daughter, Gianna, was an up-and-coming player in her own right. She played with the Los Angeles Lady Mambas, which was coached by Bryant and is part of a co-ed youth basketball league he created in partnership with the Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club.
The team plays at Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, where the group was heading Sunday morning for a tournament.
Gianna, also known as Gigi, recently posted an Instagram video of herself in action. JOHN, KERI AND ALYSSA ALTOBELLI
Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa confirmed that its head baseball coach, John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter, Alyssa, were aboard the helicopter and died in the crash. Alyssa Altobelli was a teammate of Gianna Bryant's on the Los Angeles Lady Mambas.
""We're just all in disbelief over what's been happening,"" said Gina Sanchez, John Altobelli's sister.
Speaking from her father's home in Newport Beach, she said her brother was drafted by the Miami Marlins, but soon realized he ""didn't care for it"" and left to pursue a career coaching. He later landed a job at OCC, where he also taught classes. ""John meant so much to not only Orange Coast College, but to baseball,"" Orange Coast College Athletic Director Jason Kehler said in a statement. ""He truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach. The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none — he treated them like family. Our deepest condolences go out to the Altobelli family during this time of tragedy."" Major League Baseball players also paid tribute to the longtime coach. Mets infielder Jeff McNeil tweeted that ""both the baseball and basketball world lost a great one today,"" calling Altobelli ""one of my favorite coaches I have ever played for and one of the main reasons I got a chance to play professional baseball.""
The Altobellis had two other children — a daughter, Alexis, and a son, J.J., who is a scout for the Boston Red Sox.
CHRISTINA MAUSER
Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley said on Twitter that she had learned Christina Mauser was among those killed in the crash. Foley said Mauser was a coach and the wife of Matt Mauser, lead singer for the Tijuana Dogs, a popular Orange County band. Matt Mauser had been scheduled to perform at the Brea Improv Sunday evening. The venue called off the show, saying: ""Due to unforeseen circumstances, this event has been cancelled.""
Appearing on NBC's Today Show, Matt Mauser said he and his family were doing ""as good as you can expect.""
""It's horrible. It's just horrible,"" he said, his voice cracking with emotion. ""I've got three small kids and trying to figure out how to navigate life with three kids and no mom.""
He said of Kobe Bryant: ""He didn't choose Christina for any ordinary reason, she was extraordinary... she was warm, she was incredibly bright.""
SARAH AND PAYTON CHESTER
Payton Chester, a 13-year-old basketball player, and her mother, Sarah, were also aboard the helicopter. Sarah's brother, La Serna High football coach Andy George, told the Orange County Register that Payton played for the Lady Mambas for years.
""We're just sad, I mean, we're heartbroken,"" George told the newspaper. ""It's starting to settle in a little bit, but I'm still in disbelief. We were always trying to be there for each other and we were really close.""

Zobayan was a licensed commercial helicopter pilot and was also listed as a licensed flight and ground instructor, according to FAA records.

There's a lot that is not yet known. But a letter sent to President Trump and Housing Secretary Ben Carson talks about increased federal support to expand the region's homeless shelter system.
Though Los Angeles County is home to nearly 60,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night, the county's shelter system has space for fewer than 16,000 people.
Speaking on KPCC's AirTalk program on Thursday, Andy Bales, who heads the Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row, said local officials were in direct communication with the secretary of the Federal Housing and Urban Development department, Ben Carson.
""They had a discussion yesterday [Wednesday] with Ben Carson, and I guess they've received an offer from the White House of federal assistance that asked the city and the county for a humble letter of request that that they need help,"" said Bales. ""I believe that letter is going to be on its way from the Mayor of Los Angeles, [and] County supervisor Kathryn Barger and the county supervisors, requesting White House help.""
Bales said details are still ""sketchy,"" but that he thinks the federal government will make federal land available for the construction of homeless shelters, and ask local non-profits to operate them.
On Friday morning, the Los Angeles Times published a letter sent to President Trump and Secretary Carson from Mayor Garcetti. The letter is dated January 9, 2020: ""I appreciate the federal resources that Secretary Carson offered yesterday, including support for service and housing programs; potential federal land for housing and shelter development; and leveraged resources needed to address critical public health needs."" Both Supervisor Barger and Mayor Garcetti tweeted on Wednesday evening about the partnership. HUD Secretary Ben Carson Carson also tweeted on Wednesday. Speaking on AirTalk, Andy Bales said he is ""thrilled"" that the situation on the streets is finally being addressed as an ""all hands on deck situation.""
""I know we need much more affordable housing, but what people who suffer the devastation of homelessness each and every night need right now is triage, like shelter, they need a roof of some kind over their head,"" Bales said on AirTalk.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Matt Tinoco,MZJCVJF33ZGBRIGI3IMW55VUOA,1

The Police Chief Says It's 'One of the Safest Times In Los Angeles.': LAist,"Violent crime in the city of Los Angeles has declined for the second year in a row, continuing long-term downward trends, city leaders said Monday.
""These are better crime statistics than we've seen in decades,"" said Mayor Eric Garcetti. ""I said that for the first time last year, but it's true again this year."" MURDER, SHOOTINGS AND PROPERTY CRIME ARE DOWN
There were 253 murders in 2019, making it the 10th year in a row the city had fewer than 300 homicides. The homicide rate was the lowest since 1962.
L.A. saw 65 fewer shooting victims last year — 945 — that's the lowest number in 21 years, officials said. Property crime also declined by 7.4 percent in 2019.
Today is ""one of the safest times in Los Angeles,"" said LAPD Chief Michel Moore.
Officials attributed the decline in crimes to a variety of strategies, including gang intervention, community outreach efforts and more hours of patrols.
Moore said the department has continued to invest in resources to train officers on de-escalation techniques.
There were 26 officer shootings in 2019, down from 33 in 2018 and 44 in 2017, the chief said.
""In our recorded history ... [it's] the lowest number of officer-involved shootings in our history,"" Moore said.
There was one sour note: There was an increase in fatal hit-and-runs especially in South L.A. Citywide, 62 people were killed in hit-and-run incidents, compared with 56 in 2018. The chief attributed the increase to distracted driving, texting and driving under the influence.
""Hit-and-run fatals in the city of Los Angeles is a troubling challenge for us,"" he said.
RANDOM BODY CAM AUDITS
Moore said the LAPD will expand the monitoring of body cam footage.
He said the department captures more than 14,000 videos a day from bodycam footage, he said, adding that starting this month, supervisors in each of the department's gang units will select certain videos to audit every month.
""What I think every Angeleno has the right to expect is that when a police officer has contact with them, that they're treated with dignity and with respect, and a courtesy that should be common amongst all of us,"" Moore said.
The department recently changed its procedures to require a lieutenant to review body cam video when an officer adds someone to the gang database. That move followed revelations that the LAPD is investigating at least 20 officers for altering information gathered at traffic stops to falsely identify individuals as gang members.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Elly Yu,J6AQDB6CVNEPLPH4M4AGV2IMIM,1

2020-02-04T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/02/04/los_angeles_district_attorney_race_da_candidates_voter_guide.php,Your Guide To The LA County District Attorney's Race: LAist,"The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is the largest prosecutor's office in the United States. The DA oversees a staff of roughly 1,000 lawyers, 300 investigators and 800 support staff. The office prosecutes everything from misdemeanors to felonies in an area covering more than 4,000 square miles, from the Antelope Valley to Long Beach and from Pomona to Malibu. This race has attracted national attention, because it's the latest — and largest — battleground in a national push to get reformists elected as district attorneys. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote in the March 3 primary, the top two candidates will advance to a runoff in November.
So let's meet the candidates:
JACKIE LACEY
DA Jackie Lacey, 62, is a career prosecutor. She joined the L.A. District Attorney's office as a line prosecutor in 1986, and over the years she rose through the ranks. Along the way she headed the major crimes and major narcotics units and the Central Operations Bureau. In 2011 she was elevated to Chief Deputy DA — the No. 2 position in the department. She was elected DA in 2012 and was re-elected in 2016. She is the first woman and the first African American DA in L.A. County. Lacey calls herself a ""reasonable reformer."" She touts her establishment of a mental health division in her office to work on diverting people with mental health issues away from jail. Lacey also set up a Conviction Review Unit to assess claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence. She supports bail reform but not the outright abolition of cash bail. She still seeks the death penalty for ""the worst of the worst offenders, including child murderers and serial killers,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement last year. GEORGE GASCÓN
George Gascón, 65, is an Army veteran and was a career police officer before becoming a prosecutor. He joined the LAPD in 1978 — and outside of a five-year hiatus as a car salesman, he spent more than 20 years on the force, rising to Assistant Chief. In 2006 he became police chief of Mesa Arizona, and in 2009 he became police chief of San Francisco. In 2011 he was appointed San Francisco's District Attorney. Gascón was elected to the post later that year and was re-elected in 2015. He stepped down last fall to run for DA in Los Angeles.
Gascón is running as a reformer, arguing that under Jackie Lacey the DA's office ""has lost its ability to distinguish the dangerous from the nuisance."" He co-authored Prop. 47, which lowered certain drug and theft felonies to misdemeanors. He supported Prop. 57, which made it easier for non-violent prisoners to get parole. He says he would abolish cash bail and stop pursuing the death penalty.
RACHEL ROSSI
Rachel Rossi, 36, began her career in 2011 in the office of the L.A. County Public Defender's office. She worked there for three years, and then joined the L.A. office of the Federal Public Defender. In 2017 she was detailed to the office of Senator Dick Durbin to work on criminal justice reform on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In February of last year, she became majority counsel to the House of Representatives' subcommittee on crime, terrorism and homeland security. She resigned last September to run for DA.
Rossi is running as a reformer, arguing that Lacey has ""an archaic vision of justice."" She vows to bring ""bold, transformative change"" to the DA's office. Rossi says her work as a public defender put her face to face with the fact that the vast majority of jail inmates are African American and Latino. She says she would prosecute far fewer misdemeanors, particularly those committed by homeless people. Rossi would end cash bail and stop pursuing capital punishment. A SAMPLING OF THE CANDIDATES' POSITIONS:
Criminal justice reform: Gascón and Rossi stress the need to aggressively tackle what they see as systemic racism in the criminal justice system. Gascon co-authored Prop. 47, which reduced some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors. Rossi supported the measure, while Lacey opposed it, arguing that it led to an uptick in property crime. Lacey says it's important to be aware of things like racial income disparities, but adds, ""people make bad decisions."" Lacey sees her main priority as protecting the victims of crime.
Bail reform: Gascón and Rossi call for the abolition of cash bail. Rossi criticizes Gascón for not abandoning his use of cash bail during his time as San Francisco DA. Lacey supports bail reform, but not its outright elimination. She supports the state law that would do away with cash bail in most situations (though that law is currently on hold pending the outcome of a November ballot initiative backed by the bail bonds industry that would kill it), while giving judges the opportunity to impose it in cases involving high-level misdemeanors or low-level felonies using a risk assessment tool.
Death penalty: Gascón and Rossi say they won't ever pursue it. Lacey has sought capital punishment in cases that she considers egregious.
Police shootings: Rossi has called for the use of outside prosecutors to investigate police shootings as a way to ensure a fair inquiry. Gascon says he would be willing to consider some sort of independent special prosecutor in such cases. Lacey has defended her handling of officer shootings — she has filed charges in one case in which an officer fatally shot a civilian. because it's ""very, very difficult"" to successfully prosecute law enforcement officers for shootings.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Laist Staff,KOZIUUVEZFGPBFGTSRNLM63TXE,1

But maybe winning your office Academy Awards pool is just about math. TURNING MOVIES INTO MATH
Ben Zauzmer's spent the last eight years using data analysis to predict who will win the Oscars, and he has a high rate of success — his model's even managed to top FiveThirtyEight data master Nate Silver.
By day, he's manager of baseball analytics for the Dodgers — but when he was a Harvard freshman, he wanted to know if that same approach could be applied to predicting the Academy Awards. He'd wanted to know who the math said would win that year's Oscars, but Googling didn't turn anything up.
So he decided to apply Moneyball-style principles to the movies. He spent a month in the library gathering data from websites and press releases, building his own Oscars dataset. Then he started building statistical models using information like the past winners of different awards shows, and how they correlated with who won at the Academy Awards.
He's gone on to write about what that analysis predicts for the Hollywood Reporter, as well as writing a recent book on the subject, Oscarmetrics.
He has a lot less data to work with than the incredibly detailed numbers drawn from thousands of Major League Baseball games, but told us his Oscar predictions are constantly being improved. Zauzmer adds new data sources and tweaks his model to make sure his own biases don't affect what the model spits out as the probabilities.
WHAT THE MATH PREDICTS It's an interesting year for making predictions, according to Zauzmer, with four movies receiving 10 or more nominations each for the first time ever. That could make determining the winners that much more difficult, without one film leading as clearly. Joker has 11, with 1917, the Irishman, and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood with 10 nominations each.
Looking back, one of the most surprising predictions was in 2012, Zauzmer said. The buzz was that Viola Davis would likely win Best Actress for The Help — but the math showed Meryl Streep as a slight mathematical favorite.
Streep won for The Iron Lady. Another example: Ang Lee's Best Director win for Life of Pi over Steven Spielberg and Lincoln.
The math isn't always right — sometimes the pundits manage to outscore what the hard numbers say.
""And that's to be expected, because the math is essentially establishing probabilities, rather than making predictions. And sometimes things with high probability happen and sometimes they don't,"" Zauzmer said.
WHAT THE PAST GOT WRONG One of the questions he tackles in his book: which movie should have won the Best Picture Oscar each year.
Using stats like the American Film Institute's rankings and the IMDb user votes, he breaks down what modern critics and experts believe were the best choices each year.
He wrote about all the years that the math says the Academy got it wrong.
""I challenged myself to watch every single one of these movies — not just the ones that actually won Best Picture, but also the ones that should have won Best Picture,"" Zauzmer said.
ANALYZING HIMSELF
Being who he is, Zauzmer shared his own personal work stats, and broke down how he spends his time — 95 percent on statistical work for his day job, the other 5 percent on awards.
""I get to do the Oscars work for this one month of the year, but then the rest of the year, I get to hang out at Dodger Stadium,"" Zauzmer said. ""If that split were able to continue for years in the future, I would be extremely happy.""
Oscarmetrics is available now, and the Academy Awards are this Sunday. You can read Zauzmer's predictions for the 2020 Oscars at the Hollywood Reporter.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Mike Roe,LLME5GJVMFGKBFQYISYESMA4AA,1
2020-01-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/07/how_to_become_a_cbs_crime_procedural_director.php,How To Become A 'Criminal Minds' Director â€” From Stuntwoman To CBS Procedurals: LAist,"Criminal Minds comes back Wednesday night for its 15th (!) and final season. L.A. native Diana Valentine is one of the show's directors, and she's become a go-to talent for CBS — she's directed seven episodes of Criminal Minds, 11 of NCIS: Los Angeles, and more.
Here's how she got here, plus some advice on how you can go after your dream job too.
STEP 1: FIND WHAT YOU LOVE Valentine's always been a fan of darkness — she connected with Criminal Minds over getting into the mind of serial killers and what motivates them.
""I'm one of those people who, even if I'm watching something and it's bad, I have to watch it to the end — because I have to see how it ends. I have to have that closure of the story,"" Valentine said.
She thinks of herself as an audience member first — she puts her own experience of 'OMG' or 'whaaaaat was that' back into the product, using what appeals to her as a fan to know what she's getting right as a director.
If you know up front that you want to go into filmmaking, she recommends finding a school with a film or theater program, or looking for books that fit your interests. (Yes, sorry, you might have to read books, not just watch things.)
STEP 2: TRY DIFFERENT THINGS
From a young age, she wanted to get into entertainment. She acted starting in elementary school and started out trying to be an actress — but found that career to be too random.
""There's no rhyme nor reason for anything sometimes, and I couldn't deal with the lack of control that you have over your own career as an actor,"" Valentine said.
She went to college to be an airline stewardess, but that didn't fly for her either.
""One of our things was going up in a Cessna, and they did a mid-engine stall in the air where the plane just drops — and I was like, 'Oh no, this isn't for me.'""
Valentine found an unusual foot in the door of Hollywood — she became a stuntwoman. Yes, she's more of a badass than some may think at first. One of her best friends was a stuntwoman on The Fall Guy, and the industry was hungry at the time for athletic women to join the profession.
""There were fights, and car stuff — so we'd go out and rent cars, and practice our driving, and our slides,"" Valentine said.
She did stunts on classic action shows like The A-Team, T.J. Hooker, and Airwolf.
STEP 3: MAKE STUFF
With the tools now available, Valentine recommends going out and shooting your own films if you want to get into filmmaking.
""Take your iPad, go out and shoot something. I mean, get friends together, write a script, do some shorts,"" Valentine said.
Her equivalent of walking to school in the snow, uphill, both ways: she started out shooting on film, using a director of photography connection to get access to a free camera — but she still had to pay for processing, cutting, and storing that film.
You can also volunteer to be a script supervisor for student films or ultra low-budget movies looking for help, Valentine said, where you can start putting in some hours and build your skills.
STEP 4: SUBMIT TO DIVERSITY PROGRAMS Being a female director is still unusual, but Valentine said Criminal Minds impressed her — when she did her first episode for the show in 2015, they had six women directors in a row. But one opportunity for women and others who haven't traditionally been able to get access to the industry is diversity programs, meant to expand the diversity in Hollywood.
Once you've made your own short, Valentine recommends looking for programs that you can submit to and sending your work in to as many as you can.
""And if you don't get in the first time, submit again. I mean, just do it,"" Valentine said.
She did a short called Blood Moon, about whether serial killers are born or made (more of that love of darkness mentioned above), and it helped her to find more career opportunities. There are more opportunities for female directors in television than film, Valentine noted.
You can also find mentorship programs and other places where you can submit your projects, Valentine said.
STEP 5: ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN B
While she enjoyed her time as a stuntwoman, she started to notice opportunities drying up.
""As they were starting to get cancelled later on in their run of their series, they weren't being replaced by other stunt shows, and I thought aaah... I might be out of a job soon,"" Valentine said.
Uh oh. Her plan B ended up being taking a class at UCLA with a friend of hers, learning to be a script supervisor. She was interested thanks to her own work with script supervisors while she was a stuntwoman.
""They just told you, when you get out of the car, run that way, or open the door with this hand, so it was about continuity more than anything else,"" Valentine said.
That class helped her find that being a script supervisor fit with the way her brain works. She continued to pursue being a script supervisor — her friend went on to sell real estate.
STEP 6: GET A JOB AS A SCRIPT SUPERVISOR
The way toward her goals that Valentine found was leveraging that class and landing a role as a script supervisor.
""When I first started trying to direct 15 years ago, there was really kind of no resources — you just had to get on a show,"" Valentine said.
She recommends the job for people who can multitask and have a strong attention to detail — if not, she said, it's not the career for you.
""It's a really hard job,"" Valentine said. ""To be a good script supervisor, you [also] have to have kind of a laid-back personality, because you're dealing with so many different personalities. There's different ways to approach different actors, different people.""
STEP 7: BUILD RELATIONSHIPS Once you've gotten a foot in the door, you need to keep building relationships. She'd directed one episode, but Valentine feels that her big break came when NCIS: Los Angeles was building out its crew.
Her way in: a line producer she knew from her days as a stuntwoman, and a unit production manager she knew from working as a script supervisor.
STEP 8: GET ON A SHOW THAT LASTS MORE THAN A SEASON
The first episode that Valentine ever directed was on Nip/Tuck — but it was the third-to-last episode of the series, so she didn't get another episode after that.
""You had to just have the perfect storm to be on a show with a showrunner who was willing to give you a shot, but it also had to be a show had done multiple seasons and so the studios were also willing to take that chance,"" Valentine said.
Valentine said that one key thing is getting asked back for that second episode, so that others can see that you were good enough to be asked to do more.
When she got to NCIS: Los Angeles, she told people at the show that she'd just finished her first episode directing, and they were interested. She got to direct her first episode of that show during its third season, two episodes the following season.
Eventually, executive producer Shane Brennan said she had to make a choice.
""He said, 'If you want to be a director, I'll give you three episodes to direct next year,'"" Valentine said.
She quit supervising and committed to directing full time.
STEP 9: PERFECT YOUR CRAFT
Brennan also guided her, sitting with her in editing and telling her why shots either did or didn't work. Valentine said that women don't tend to get that chance to hone their craft, and that when women direct an episode that isn't fantastic, shows just move on.
""But there's a lot of male directors who've gotten shot, over shot, over shot, where they've perfected their craft, and they've gotten better,"" Valentine said.
CBS's procedurals have proven willing to give chances to directors without as much experience, according to Valentine, letting her learn and grow.
""They have no qualms about giving people shots, [including] directors who have directed other things but maybe not done 40 hours of television,"" Valentine said.
The more prepared you are, the better your episode goes, according to Valentine.
""It goes smoothly, the more the crew is happy with you because you know what you're doing,"" Valentine said. ""You're not standing around on set going, 'OK, what do we do now?'""
STEP 10: NO MATTER WHAT, KEEP GOING
Whatever your path, Valentine urges people to keep going after what they want.
""People who have dreams and want to pursue directing, or any other part of the industry — don't let people say that you're too old, or you're too this, or you're too that,"" Valentine said. ""Just pursue your dreams — you're never too old until you're not walking this earth anymore.""
Criminal Minds airs Wednesday nights on CBS. Valentine directed the sixth episode of this season, ""Ghosts.""

2020-01-07T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/07/thrift_shop_tips_deals.php,It's Now The Season Of Prime Thrift Store Shopping. How To Nab The Good Stuff: LAist,"Here's something aficionados of thrift-store shopping may already know: December always brings a flood of donations, from used clothing to furniture to household items.
And that makes January a prime time to hit the secondhand stores.
""It's always been a tradition that our donors donate between Christmas and New Year's,"" explained Goodwill Southern California director of logistics Tinna Bauer. ""And the last couple days of the year, they donate even more.""
She said that rush is likely due to the Dec. 31 deadline for tax-deductible contributions, as well as folks cleaning up after the holiday season or maybe dispensing with a few excess Christmas gifts.
While she doesn't have the official numbers yet, Bauer said the year-end wave caps a big year in donations — a phenomenon she credited, in part, to the popularity of Marie Kondo's Netflix show, ""Tidying Up,"" which was released at the start of 2019.
So what does this flood of donations mean for area thrift shops and shoppers?
HOW TO GET A GOOD DEAL
I asked for your tips, and KPCC listener Katie Kurutz from Pasadena answered the call. Kurutz said she has been thrifting since she was little. She visits her local thrift shop about once a week because she can get great deals, help the environment by not creating more clothing waste, and support Goodwill's workforce re-entry work.
Because so many people donated so many items at the end of 2019, she said now is a great time to get a good deal. Just a few days ago, she found an $85 J. Crew skirt for $7 at her favorite location, the Goodwill at the corner of Altadena and Foothill Boulevard.
Her No. 1 piece of advice for people trying thrifting for the first time?
""Never go with an expectation,"" she said. ""If you have sort of a rough outline of something that you're looking for, that's fine and will help you go to the right rack, but never think that you're going to get the thing that you're looking for, because that's just not the way it works. You have to be open to the thrift store gods and let them tell you what you need.""
She also urges thrift shoppers looking for a good deal to:
Visit often (""You've got to increase your probability because it's a game of chance."")
Set an item limit for each visit (""I'm going to have to wash and store these pieces, so let's not walk away with 10."")
Go first to the rack by the fitting room for a curated selection (""People have already culled through things and pulled some things out that might be interesting."")
Check the clothes closely (""Always look at the armpits for stains ... you just can't get them out."")
Be nice! (""Sometimes people just drop stuff on the ground or things get kicked around, so just always be cognizant and hang stuff back up."")
The general manager at a different Pasadena Goodwill Southern California also advised visiting on days when there are special sales, like half-price and dollar days.
""If they see something that they like and they want it, they need to buy it right away, because if you come back tomorrow — it may not be here,"" the manager warned. WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES
So what do thrift shops do with this new year bounty? It depends on the organization.
For the sake of explanation and simplicity, I'll use three thrift shops that sell donated used goods within a half mile radius of the KPCC/LAist newsroom in Pasadena.
According to Goodwill Southern California, the money raised by selling the donated items funds job training and career services. Items sold in Salvation Army in Southern California thrift shops benefit the organization's drug and alcohol treatment program, according to divisional commander Lt. Col. John Chamness. And at the Huntington Collection, proceeds from sales go to the Huntington Senior Care Network, which ""helps older and disabled adults and families remain healthy and independent."" TIPS FOR DONORS
Maybe you are looking to downsize, not increase, your personal collection.
Diane Velez brought books, professional clothing, bags, and formal wear to her local Savers in Arcadia.
Initially, she wanted to give them away to socially conscious women on Instagram or to organize a clothing swap, but ultimately, donating them for resale in a thrift shop was more convenient.
When she got there last week, Velez said there was a line. The green bin where donations are collected was completely full.
Bauer from Goodwill Southern California said the busiest season for donations is coming to an end, though, so donors shouldn't have much trouble dropping items off at their local donation center going forward — though she did point out that some Goodwill donation centers might not have enough space to safely accept furniture.
Staff at a Pasadena donation center recommended donors call ahead to make sure there is enough space for whatever they're bringing.
And they remind folks that they can't accept items that can be recalled, like car seats, strollers, or cribs, for safety reasons.

For some businesses, it's posing what could become an existential threat.
Local travel agencies that cater to the Chinese community are seeing so many cancellations right now that some are afraid of being driven out of business.
It certainly isn't helping that the U.S. State Department is telling travelers not to go to China, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending Americans avoid all non-essential travel there.
The outbreak could hit mom-and-pop travel agencies especially hard, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.
'SOME MAY OPT TO CLOSE'
""If all they specialize in is travel to and from China and they have very limited financial reserves, it's possible some may opt to close,"" he said.
The coronavirus situation is unprecedented, said Harteveldt, who has decades of experience studying the travel industry. ""This is the first time that I can recall seeing either countries or individual airlines announce suspension of all flights to a specific country specifically because of a health matter,"" he said.
Thousands of travelers are being forced to rethink their plans right now. That includes John DiScala, who's been planning a trip to Southeast Asia for months.
""I'm going to cancel the trip because I have two little kids at home,"" he told us.
An L.A.-based travel writer, DiScala recently wrote a piece on his blog asking readers whether he should cancel his Asia travel plans.
""I would say 98% of the people said, 'Do not go,'"" DiScala said. ""So that was like, 'Ok, I'm staying home, I'm not even going to take a chance.'""
'CANCEL, CANCEL, CANCEL'
Monterey Park travel agent Anthony Ng said this is the worst catastrophe he's had to weather in the 11 years he's been in business.
""We had multiple cancellations, multiple refunds,"" he said. ""Even trips out to summer are all cancelled right now.""
Fifty of Ng's clients cancelled trips in January alone, he said.
Ng's company, Elite 5 Star Travel, is in a strip mall above a supermarket that caters to the area's large Asian American population. He understands the fears surrounding coronavirus. Ng keeps a face mask on his desk, mostly to reassure customers.
""I felt weird going to the post office the other day not wearing a mask,"" he said.
Less than a mile from Elite 5 Star Travel is Sky and Sea Travel, where agent Cindy Lu is facing the same problem.
""Cancel, cancel, cancel,"" Lu said as she read through a list of clients.
Even clients who have travel plans to areas of Asia outside of China are cancelling, she said.
Ng is hoping his business can survive, but added, ""the difficult thing is, it's going to go on. It's not going to just [be fixed] overnight or in a month it's going to be taken care of.""
He and his partner are ""crossing our fingers, we're praying we can make it throughout the year,"" Ng said.
He worries his business will continue to suffer even after the coronavirus outbreak is contained, since it may take some time for people to get over their fear of traveling to Asia.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Robert Garrova,6LPZDLLFURE2DK3FDILKZZMDRU,1

There's the choice of cheese, of bread, of butter. How much of each item do you use? Do you grill or toast it? For how long? What about condiments? And soups? And sides?
For some of us, grilled cheese is more than a nostalgic childhood staple or a quickie meal — it offers solace. It smoothes out the indignities of a bad workday and soothes the sting of unwelcome news. It's the ultimate comfort food, simple enough to be made by a child and universal enough you can find the ingredients almost anywhere.
It's also a modern Los Angeles classic, made with all kinds of intentions and iterations. Clementine
For 19 years, long before grilled cheese sammies became a gourmet staple, chef Annie Miler has spent every April celebrating Grilled Cheese Month. This year, the menu will feature a custom grilled cheese sandwich for each of the twelve zodiac signs. Year-round, Clementine has a build-your-own grilled cheese option that allows you to get creative with six types of cheese (one is vegan), veggies and proteins. Sandwiches start at $9.50 and are available at both locations. Don't want to overthink it? Their classic — made with crunchy, buttery La Brea Bakery country white bread, gooey Tillamook cheddar crisped along the edges and out-of-this-world pickles — is always a good choice.
1751 Ensley Ave., Century City. 310-552-1080. 
9346 Civic Center Dr., Beverly Hills. 310-461-0600. Grub
Grub, created by Denise DeCarlo and Betty Fraser, offers the After-School Special featuring golden sourdough, sharp cheddar, Swiss cheese and fragrant dill butter. Served with their hint-of-tarragon tomato soup, the combo costs $14.50. Make sure to try the Fosse Cookie, a chocolate and potato chip treat made from general manager Libby Fosse-Dunne's family recipe.
911 N. Seward St., Hollywood. 323-461-3663. The Apple Pan
The $7 grilled cheese at the Apple Pan serves as a reminder not to underestimate the power of basic ingredients. Choose between Swiss or Tillamook cheddar and white, wheat or rye bread. If you don't specify, you'll get melted-to-perfection cheddar on white bread with a side of black olives and crinkle-cut, cinnamon-tinged pickle coins. It's fast, no-frills diner food. Save room for one of the housemade pies (we vote for banana cream). 
10801 W. Pico Blvd., West L.A. 310-475-3585. Esters Wine Shop & Bar
Provolone, Reggiano and Reading cheese are blended with béchamel that oozes out from slices of salted pain de mie baked at Milo + Olive, Esters Wine Shop & Bar's sister spot. On first bite, you'll understand why the sandwich — the first recipe in chef Jeremy Fox's cookbook On Vegetables — costs $17. It's paired with cornichons and a spicy red pepper jam made by the mother of a former server. (They still source the jam from Shelley Kusch of Garden Junkie in Napa Valley.)
1314 Seventh St., Santa Monica. 310-899-6900. The Melt
The Melt's $5.99 best-seller places muenster, fontina and sharp cheddar between slices of French bread. But you could argue that the $6.79 Mac Daddy grilled cheese — creamy mac 'n' cheese with flawlessly cooked noodles (not too soft, not too al dente), sharp and medium cheddar, smoked bacon and crisp onions — is what makes the Melt stand out (vegetarians can order it without bacon). It's a comfort food collision in the best way.
735 S. Figueroa St., downtown L.A. 213-344-4903. 
The Hat
The Hat is best known for its pastrami sandwiches but it also makes a killer grilled cheese. The bread is so crunchy you'll think it was dipped in butter. The cheese is as gooey and as American as it gets. Together, they create a simple, nostalgic sammie that costs only $4.29. Staffers are happy to customize it with add-ons and your choice of bread. In a world that can be overwhelming, the Hat makes a classic sandwich, done right.

Imagine an In-N-Out grilled cheese but bigger, more aggro and with a California diner twist. The creaminess of the mashed avocado is perfect with the sharpness of the cheese while the tomatoes add acidity and the grilled onions bring sweetness. Swingers stays open late and this is an ideal way to fill your stomach after a night out.

802 Broadway, Santa Monica. 310-393-9793. Badmaash
The Bombay Grilled Cheese on Badmaash's DTLA brunch menu (served on weekends from noon to 3 p.m.) is the Mahendro family's take on Indian gastropub fare. The $12 sandwich stars white cheddar, serrano chilies, onions and cilantro on a buttery sourdough. It's not extremely spicy but it has enough kick to make it stand out amid blander offerings in the world of grilled cheese. It also comes with a side of Maggi sauce, a flavor-amplifying seasoning that has the consistency of soy sauce. 
108 W. 2nd St., downtown L.A. 213-221-7466. 
418 N. Fairfax Ave., Fairfax. 213-281-5185. Post & Beam
Chef John Cleveland offers a hidden gem during Post & Beam's happy hour, which occurs Tuesday through Friday, from 4 to 7 p.m. It's their pressed grilled cheese sandwich made with smoked mozzarella, braised oxtail and onion chutney served on crusty ciabatta. The cheese and meat bring depth and smokiness while the onion chutney adds acidity to the collision of flavors. 
3767 Santa Rosalia Dr., Crenshaw. 323-299-5599. The Carving Board
David and Yoav Adir's the Carving Board embraces the spectrum of grilled cheese with five different sandwiches that'll run you $6.50 to $10.50. The mozzarella and cheddar is simple yet finger-licking good while the French onion features slow-cooked sweet onions. The crab cake, served with mozzarella and cheddar, is accompanied by roasted garlic mustard aioli. The margarita pairs fresh mozzarella with grilled tomato and sweet basil while the buffalo chicken marries mozzarella and aged blue cheese. All sandwiches are served on toasty pain de mie.

When a waffle meets a grilled cheese, what do you get? A sandwich that delights in texture as much as it does in taste. Stuffed with muenster, provolone and a tart garlic butter, Waffle Love's $11 croissant-waffle sandwich brings sweetness to a savory meal. Paired with tomato bisque, it's a model brunch food for those times when you can't decide whether you want breakfast or lunch.
9411 Reseda Blvd., Northridge. 747-206-5047. 
3768 Long Beach Blvd., Long Beach. 562-336-1215. Cassell's Hamburgers
If you want a diner-style grilled cheese, look no further. Cassell's beautifully buttered $7 sandwich is filled with cheddar, Swiss and mozzarella that oozes out from between the bread and turns crisp. Imagine a grilled cheese studded with flecks of Cheez-Its and served with a side of ""tomato jam"" (i.e. fancy ketchup that may spoil your love for Heinz). Definitely get an order of their Kennebec or sweet potato waffle fries.

LAX: Terminal 1 - Southwest Airlines, 1 World Way. The Original Grilled Cheese Truck
The Original Grilled Cheese Truck is like a rainbow of grilled cheese sandwiches. With sweet and savory options, 14 add-ons and three types of crusts, chef David Danhi isn't messing around. The melt that started it all, the $9 Cheesy Mac & Rib, delights with sharp cheddar cheese, smoky barbecued pork, carmelized onions and creamy mac and cheese. If you have room, follow it with a $6 PB Banana Melt, which layers sliced bananas and salty potato chips onto peanut butter mascarpone.

But on what was supposed to be their last day aboard the Diamond Princess, Carl Goldman and Jeru Seratti-Goldman of Santa Clarita got a twist they were not expecting.
""We learned that one of the passengers who had exited in Hong Kong had come down with the virus,"" Goldman said. Officials later diagnosed a number of passengers with coronavirus, and the ship was placed in quarantine.
Now the couple is stuck with about 3,700 other passengers and crew members in a port in Yokohama as they wait out a two-week period of isolation.
Goldman and Seratti-Goldman, who own KHTS radio in the Santa Clarita Valley, are writing about their ordeal on the station's website. They're also posting Facebook Live videos that illustrate what it's like being stuck in small quarters on board a massive ship. ""I think the reason I haven't killed my husband yet is because our friends are here,"" Seratti-Goldman said jokingly during a livestream over the weekend.
""When people bring us meals, they serve us meals with masks,"" Seratti-Goldman said, adding, ""the meals are delicious.""
She said ""this is the longest we've ever been gone from home,"" but the couple have remained stoic in their dispatches from the ship, even as Japanese health officials reported a total of 135 passengers and crew have now tested positive for coronavirus.
LIKE A 'TV MOVIE'
Reached by phone, Carl Goldman told us thermometers Japanese officials provided to check for fever have helped him and his wife keep their composure.
""Any time either of us coughs — or sneezes or sniffles — we're grabbing the thermometer,"" he said. ""It's the best sign of relief we could possibly have.""
Since they've started posting their experience on social media, they've gotten a lot of responses from fearful people who don't want them to return home, Goldman said.
""There is a lot of misinformation out there,"" he said. ""We're perfectly safe once we get home.""
Seratti-Goldman provided Facebook Live viewers with a tour of their cabin, where they're washing their clothes in the bathtub and getting big bottles of water delivered. The two even managed to catch the Academy Awards on the TV in their room, she said.
From the room's balcony, Seratti-Goldman provided a look at what's going on around the ship, as ambulances lined up to transport infected passengers to area hospitals. ""I feel like I'm in a TV movie,"" Seratti-Goldman said.

The design, which is still open to tweaks before it's formally accepted, includes more walking and jogging paths, nature and wildlife habitats, a great lawn and water overlooks, an educational center and re-imagined dog parks. ""The master plan... includes prioritizing habitat for nature and wildlife, but it also includes a lot of spaces for people,"" said Sarah Ullman, the co-chair of the Silver Lake Neighborhood Council's reservoir committee. ""It strives to make the reservoir a more equitable place and a more accessible place for people and wildlife at the same time.""
The project got underway in March of 2018 after approval from the L.A. City Council. Landscape architecture and planning firm Hargreaves Jones, whose recent work includes Zaryadye Park in Moscow, Scissortail Park in Oklahoma City and Crescent Park in New Orleans, will be the lead design consultant.
Chee Salette will serve as the local landscape architect. The Glendale-based firm is also designing the Taylor Yard Park in Frogtown. eave Jones presented three possible designs for the reservoir and solicited public feedback via an online questionnaire.
According to Ullman, almost 4,000 people have responded to the surveys altogether.
""We're really looking at this as sort of a shared vision for the reservoir and [its] future,"" she said. Thursday's community meeting was the fourth such gathering. The city hopes to unveil a final design in May at the fifth and final community meeting, and to hold a celebration at that time.
Construction, however, likely won't start for several years.
""This is simply the initial design phase,"" said Ullman. ""And then we will have to apply for grants and for funding from the city and elsewhere... So it's still, you know, quite a few years away.""","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Laist Staff,WW6PGHQXKRFBVCMIITUWMNXLOA,1

Construction is wrapping up at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, set to open later this year in the Miracle Mile neighborhood.
The exact opening date — Dec. 14, 2020 — was announced by Tom Hanks at Sunday night's Academy Awards ceremony.
The museum seeks to combine both the art and science of filmmaking in its exhibitions, with a focus throughout on the collaborative nature of film. But for now, color tests are still on the walls and the whine of construction saws is the soundtrack.
We took an early tour on Friday — here's what we saw.
WHAT ARE THE MUSEUM'S STRUCTURES LIKE? There are two main structures and a set of skybridges connecting them. The overall aesthetic is intentionally industrial, courtesy of Italian architect Renzo Piano designing the updated campus.
The 300,000-square-foot museum's main building has been renamed the Saban Building, formerly known as the May Company Building. It was built in 1939, home to the May Company department store and designed by the same architect as the Million Dollar Theater movie palace and L.A. City Hall — appropriate for a building combining the history of film and the politics of the Oscars. It's been completely renovated to house the Academy's collections, though the installations are yet to be installed. Connected to the main building by skybridges is the museum's new architectural signature: the Sphere Building. The giant spherical structure has an open, not-quite-complete top reminiscent of a certain not-a-moon. Inside, it features the 1,000-seat David Geffen Theatre, all done up in red carpet red.
The giant sphere is the stuff of Indiana Jones' nightmares. But the Academy promises the ""base isolator"" supports holding it up are earthquake-safe — so, at least in theory, one of the best spots in an earthquake may be underneath that sphere. (But we won't blame you if you step away anyway.) The museum's most spectacular events space is at the top of the sphere — the outdoor Dolby Family Terrace featuring panoramic views of the city, from the Hollywood Sign to the Getty. Someone on our tour was overheard saying that view was enough to give you vertigo.
You may be tempted to belt out ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" on the way to the terrace — you'll be crossing over the Barbra Streisand skybridge, so it's a natural reaction. The terrace is an indoor-outdoor space, with a metal and glass structure that shifts with the sun throughout the day, providing shade as you look out over the city. The floor itself contains coils to help keep the space both heated and — as is often needed in Los Angeles — cooled.
""It's great having you all in the building, because I can start to imagine having visitors in here,"" Museum Chief Operating Officer Brendan Connell, Jr. said.
WHAT SORT OF EXHIBITS WILL BE ON DISPLAY? One of the galleries with a famous name is located directly off the main building's first-floor Grand Lobby: the Spielberg Family Gallery. That space will host rotating exhibitions, yet to be announced.
However, we did hear about one of the early pieces of the core exhibitions. They'll be looking at the collaborative filmmaking behind a movie from the same year the May Building was built: the Wizard of Oz. Go ahead and click your heels together — you'll be able to see Dorothy's famed ruby slippers. The second and third floors are home to the museum's core collection, but they won't hold permanent exhibitions — they plan to rotate things out around once a year, continuing to evolve over time. However, curator Doris Berger said the museum will feature both significant moments in cinema history and focus on people who've historically been overlooked.
Galleries on the third floor will include exhibitions co-curated by notable filmmakers. One of those early exhibitions will be focused on science fiction and fantasy films, taking a look at what goes into creating invented worlds. The exhibition will be covering film history over the almost 120 years since Georges Méliès' A Trip to the Moon. The fourth floor houses rotating exhibitions.The first planned exhibition features the work of Hayao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli anime films. They'll have production materials and drawings, as well as large-scale productions of the most iconic moments from beloved moveis like Howl's Moving Castle and My Neighbor Totoro. The exhibition will also feature spatial installations, intended to create what curators described as ""magical experiences.""
Their second rotating exhibition will be ""Regeneration: Black Cinema 1900-1970,"" bringing light to chronically overlooked members of movie history.
""We are building a museum that will fully reflect the wide variety of stories connected to cinema and motion pictures — celebratory stories, as well as more complicated, incomplete stories,"" museum director Kramer said. ""We want to tell stories from many points of view.""
WHAT SORT OF SCREENINGS AND PROGRAMS WILL BE HELD THERE? They plan to hold frequent film screenings in their two main theaters, the David Geffen Theater in the Sphere and the smaller 288-seat Ted Mann Theater on the museum's main building basement level.
Plans for the Geffen include previews, film premieres, special presentations, and daily screenings. One of the Mann's first programs will be celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the birth of surrealist filmmaker Federico Fellini, and they'll also be screening Miyazaki animated features alongside his rotating exhibition. They also plan to screen Saturday morning matinees and a global film series.
Both theaters will feature live performances, lectures, panels, and other events. The Geffen features the ability to show films in 16-millimeter, 35-millimeter, 70-millimeter, digital laser, and even to safely screen classic nitrate-based film. There's also a stage that can accommodate an orchestra, able to play live for screenings.
Museum officials also speculated they might even hold film screenings out on that open-air terrace, or perhaps use it for a fancy gala. Maybe combine the two for an Academy-level fundraiser?
The museum also has an education arm. The Shirley Temple Education Studio, down in the basement, will feature educational programs showcasing different approaches to filmmaking, aimed toward high school students.
HOW DO I GET THERE?
The museum is located at the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax, in the Miracle Mile area of L.A., just across from the Petersen Automotive Museum and down the street from LACMA and the La Brea Tar Pits.
It's part of Mid-Wilshire's Museum Row. Metro busses can get you there, if you don't want to drive, and a Purple Line train stop is set to open in 2023. They were doing construction on the line just outside the museum as we took our tour.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GET IN?
While there will be an adult charge for admission, the museum was endowed by George Lucas to allow everyone 17 and under to visit for free admission — forever. No details are available yet on how much those adults tickets will cost; officials said that is still being studied. They also plan to collaborate with Lucas's Lucas Museum of Narrative Art when it opens.
The museum opens Dec. 14 — special exhibition co-curators are set to be announced soon.

The fuel dump, which appeared to occur at a low altitude, left more than 60 people, including school children, with minor injuries.
Delta Airlines Flight 89 was bound for Shanghai when it had to turn back due to mechanical issues. Federal Aviation Administration officials said on Wednesday that a review of communications with air traffic controllers found the airline crew ""did not tell air traffic control that they needed to dump fuel.""
The FAA said ""air crews will typically notify air traffic control of an emergency and indicate they need to dump fuel. Air traffic controllers will then direct the plane to the appropriate fuel-dumping area.""
Our friends at the L.A. Times took a graphical look at what happened on Tuesday: A nearby resident apparently caught the dump on video: THE CONTEXT
Airplanes often take off with extra fuel that would put them over the maximum weight allowed for a safe landing, according to a recent explainer from USA Today.
In rare cases in which not enough fuel has been consumed before landing, they can release excess to lower the plane's weight. Normally this is done at high enough altitudes that the fuel vaporizes.
Here's a video from another 777 dumping fuel, in which you can see twin jets of fuel spraying from outlets on the outer edges of the two wings. ON THE GROUND
Word spread quickly on Tuesday that jet fuel had landed on the playground at Park Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy. In all, 20 children and 11 adults who were outside at the time reported minor injuries.
By the end of the day, it was clear the fuel dump covered a wider area east of the airport.
In addition to the 31 patients at Park Avenue Elementary, L.A. County Fire and L.A. City Fire officials said they treated:
Six people at Tweedy Elementary in South Gate
One person at Graham Elementary in the Florence-Firestone area
Six people at San Gabriel Elementary in South Gate
16 people at Jordan High School & 93rd Street Elementary in South L.A.
In addition, at a news conference Tuesday night Downey Fire Department officials said they treated seven children and adults, some at a preschool, some at a home.
Authorities said they used soap and water to treat patients on the scene and no one was taken to a hospital. But parents of affected students said they have questions.
""Why choose a small city, a residential area to dump those fuels? That's not OK,"" said Nadine Escobar, whose 10-year-old daughter attends Park Avenue Elementary.
Escobar was also critical of school officials for not immediately communicating what had happened. She said her daughter seems fine, but is complaining of itching and she wonders who will take responsibility if other health issues arise.
Cudahy Mayor Elizabeth Alcantor said LAUSD was cleaning school grounds and L.A. County Fire Battalion Chief Jason Robertson said all LAUSD schools will be open Wednesday.
THE TIMELINE
According to the FAA, Delta Air Lines Flight 89 declared an emergency shortly after departing from LAX en route to Shanghai.
LAX officials said the flight was experiencing mechanical issues when it turned back. The plane, a Boeing 777, made an emergency landing at 11:57 a.m. It's scheduled departure time on Tuesday was listed at 11:19 a.m.
Delta Airlines officials said in a statement: ""The aircraft landed safely after a release of fuel, which was required as part of normal procedure to reach a safe landing weight. We are in touch with Los Angeles World Airports and the LA County Fire Department and share concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children at a school in the area.""

For funsies, KPCC's Take Two asked listeners if they had ... a favorite one? The response was a resounding, ""NO,"" but there was one that stood out as overwhelmingly tolerable: the 2. The 2 Freeway runs 87 miles from Echo Park to the San Gabriel Mountains. It's periodically been written about, and it's a favorite for its scenic views and relative emptiness. It's even inspired love letters. Here's a piece of from Brenda Rees, published on The Eastsider:
""...the 2 throws off its unassuming cloak of ordinary and transforms into an engineering marvel that promises - and DELIVERS - an exhilarating driving experience with matching natural scenery.""
But once upon time, the 2 was supposed to cut through Silver Lake and intersect with the 101, then continue west through Hollywood and into Beverly Hills all the way to the 405. Consequently, it was once known as the Beverly Hills Freeway.
So what happened?
To understand that, you need to take a step back and understand that early L.A. city planners once had a grand vision for our freeways.
""In 1959, state highway engineers planned a 1,500-mile freeway network crisscrossing the L.A. region,"" Robert Petersen, host of Hidden History L.A., told us. ""No neighborhood was to be more than four miles from a freeway.""
Initially, these plans looked like they would become a reality. But by the late '60s and early 1970s, funding issues, rising construction costs, community opposition, protracted litigation, environmental concerns, appeals for mass transit, and options other than freeways, all contributed to an uncertain future for freeways in Los Angeles.
It was these types of obstacles that ended up stopping the 2 freeway extension and grounding it in Echo Park.
""There were disputes between the city, the county, and the state,""said Petersen. ""Oh, there was also funding problems. Freeways got more and more and more and more expensive. And then finally, community opposition ... And then once you had a lot of community opposition, just like we've seen with the 710 that trying to finish that, it's hard. You need a lot of political will and that just wasn't there.""
Though it would have, in theory, capitalized on convenience, the failed extension of the 2 brought about something else.
""If you ever think about the corner in Silver Lake — of Silver Lake Boulevard and Sunset — where all those restaurants are, the freeway would have gone right through there,"" said Petersen. ""So all those restaurants all those homes would have been demolished. And really the character of Silver Lake would have been radically transformed if the freeway had gone through there.""

2020-01-13T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/13/boat fire_conception_santa barbara_legal claims_.php,Wrongful Death Claims Have Been Filed For 4 People Who Died In The Conception Boat Fire: LAist,"The families of four people who died in last year's Conception dive boat fire off the coast of Santa Barbara have filed wrongful death claims against the vessel's owners.
In federal court filings Monday, the families' lawyers allege boat owner Truth Aquatics violated a number of Coast Guard regulations, including not having a ""roving"" safety watchman. The fire killed 34 people on Labor Day.
""[That's] a federal law, which requires that someone be up at night, patrolling the vessel,"" said Robert Mongeluzzi, a lawyer representing the families. ""It is to prevent the very catastrophe that occurred.""
A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board said no one was standing watch when the fire broke out in the middle of the night.
The filings also allege the vessel failed to have safe methods of storing and charging lithium ion batteries, and had insufficient emergency exits.
""Failure to have redundancy — different means to get out — gave the victims trapped below deck no way to get out of their bunks, no way to get free of this fire, and resulted in 34 horrific, agonizing deaths of the victims,"" said Jeff Goodman, another attorney representing the families.
The claims were filed on behalf of Dr. Sanjeeri Deopujari, 31, of Norwalk, Connecticut, and her husband, Kaustubh Nirmal, 33, of New York; Yulia Krashennaya, 40, of Berkeley, and crew member Alexandra ""Allie"" Kurtz, 26, an Illinois native who had moved to California.
AN ATTEMPT TO LIMIT LIABILITY WITH AN OLD LAW
The claims come in response to a lawsuit Truth Aquatics filed a few days after the tragedy in an attempt to protect itself from paying damages. It cited an 1851 law, which allows a company to avoid financial liability if it can prove it was not at fault for a maritime accident.
""We're saying we are going to defeat you in this ... action and hold you accountable, Mongeluzzi said.
Truth Aquatics did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Despite its efforts to limit its liability, Truth Aquatics is already facing two lawsuits stemming from the fire.
A crew member who survived, Ryan Sims, alleges in a lawsuit filed Sept. 12 that the Conception's owners were negligent in their failure to properly train crew members, give adequate safety and medical equipment and provide safety rules, among other claims.
Christine Dignam, whose husband, Justin Dignam, died in the fire, sued in November, claiming the boat was unsafe.
EXEMPT FROM TOUGHER SAFETY RULES
The Conception was among more than 100 California boats exempted from strict U.S. Coast Guard rules designed to improve passenger safety during emergencies, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The paper found that 11 boats classified solely for diving — including eight in California — were given special exemptions from 1996 safety standards. Those rules were prompted by a number of fires and other accidents that had killed dozens in the previous 30 years.
The grandfathering provision meant those boats didn't have to make changes such as adding larger escape hatches and enhanced fire prevention systems, the Times reported.
Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Westlake Village) told the paper in a statement that Congress ""must eliminate the hazards posed by boats grandfathered in under outdated safety regulations.""
The Conception disaster brought the Coast Guard's oversight under close scrutiny.
The Times reported in November that the Coast Guard repeatedly ignored National Transportation Safety Board recommendations to improve fire safety measures for small passenger boats for two decades.
Brownley and two other members of Congress have introduced legislation to require dive boats to have at least two escape exits, strengthen standards for fire alarm systems and create mandatory safety rules for the handling and storage of phones, cameras and other electronic devices with lithium-ion batteries. THE COAST GUARD IS REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING SOME SAFETY UPGRADES
The Coast Guard is considering some new safety regulations, according to two local dive boat operators who have spoken with agency officials.
One big change under consideration: People would no longer be allowed to sleep side-by-side in one bed.
People often sleep next to each other on boats that offer a ""double-bunk."" Ken Kollwitz, the owner of Channel Island Dive Adventures, told KPCC/LAist the Coast Guard considers that arrangement a safety risk because the beds are against a wall, making it difficult for the person closest to the wall to exit in an emergency.
The Coast Guard is also considering a rule that would require dive boats to have more staff awake when docked or at anchor, according to Kollwitz and Ted Cumming, owner of Cal Boat Diving.
While current regulations require just one crew member to be awake at night, the Coast Guard may now require a captain and a deckhand to be awake at night, Kollwitz said.
The Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment on Kollwitz and Cumming's remarks.
The NTSB has repeatedly called on the Coast Guard to require small vessels to conduct regular inspections and report maintenance and repair needs for all of a boat's systems — including the hull and mechanical and electrical operations, the L.A. Times reported. The agency argues this would improve safety on boats between Coast Guard inspections, which occur every one to two years, according to the Times.
But the paper reported that the Coast Guard has pushed back on the recommendation, calling it ""unnecessarily burdensome and duplicative of existing requirements.""","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Elly Yu,57JKYPQJYJBRVAFBSWTM2D274M,1

But, if you're the parent of a young child in California filing this year I may have good news for you: You could receive up to an additional $1,000 back. That's on top of existing Earned Income Tax Credits which could net you hundreds - or thousands - of dollars (more on that later).
THE BASICS
This is the first year people can claim the state's Young Child Tax Credit.
Parents of children under six, who made at least one dollar in 2019, and less than $30,000, can be eligible. But to get it, you must file a tax return.
Yes, technically, if you make below a certain amount of money, you don't have to file one. But people like Sara Sgarlata, who coordinates a free tax prep site in Boyle Heights, really, really want you to.
""Don't miss out on dollars that can go back in your pocket,"" Sgarlata said.
And remember, if you made less than $56,000 last year, you can get professional help filing your taxes for free. Find a place near you here.
(If you plan to file with TurboTax make sure you're not paying when it should be free. ProPublica reported more than 14 million people unnecessarily paid for the software last year.)
HOW IT WORKS
The Young Child Tax Credit is what's called a refundable credit.
""You don't have to pay them back, you can use the money,"" said Franchise Tax Board spokesman Jason Montiel. ""It's yours to use for whatever you need.""
If you owe income tax, the credit chips away at what you owe.
If you file electronically, the direct deposit could show up in a few weeks. Sending your taxes by mail could take months.
AND THERE'S MORE
People who get the Young Child Tax Credit also qualify for the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, which was created in 2015.
This is another way people who make less than $30,000 can get money back. The general rule is that people with lower earnings and/or more children qualify for larger credits.
You must also:
Be at least 18 years old (or if you're younger, have a child)
Have a valid social security number
Have lived in California for at least half the year
UNCLAIMED FREE MONEY
The state estimates 400,000 people could qualify for the new Young Child Tax Credit.
But here's the problem. You have to file your taxes to get the tax credit money and many people — for various reasons — don't.
For example, with the state Earned Income Tax Credit, a survey from the California Budget and Policy Center found only one in five people who were eligible had even heard of the program.
Researchers have tried mailing people letters telling them about the tax credit and found it had basically no effect.
California is trying to fix this and offered $10 million in grants last year to help promote the tax credit programs and offer free tax prep help.
HERE'S WHAT YOU COULD GET:
One of the places offering help is El Centro De Ayuda in Boyle Heights. This is the second year Elena Landa has come here to file for taxes. The mom of three works as a dishwasher.
""Me siento un poco nerviosa,"" Landa said, admitting she was a little nervous that she didn't bring all her paperwork.
Within an hour, her taxes were done. Including the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (make sure to ask about that too), the state's version, and the new Young Child Tax Credit, her refund was more than $10,000.
She plans to use the money to pay rent, buy clothes for her daughters, save for an emergency and support family in Mexico.
""Gracias a dios por todo esto,"" Landa said. ""Thank God."" Between state and federal credits, a parent can significantly boost their income. The California Budget and Policy Center estimates that a parent of two children who works full-time and made $24,000 last year could increase their income by 39%, and the same parent who made $6,000 would increase their income by 99%.
The federal Child and Earned Income Tax Credits work similarly to California's, but have slightly different rules.
""Tax credits are a very simple way to pull people out of poverty because they put cash in people's pockets,"" said Alissa Anderson, a senior policy analyst at the center.

Following one of the strongest years for female filmmakers in recent memory, Oscar voters failed to nominate Little Women's Greta Gerwig — or any other woman — for directing, and the sole non-white actor up for a trophy is Cynthia Erivo, who played the abolitionist Harriet Tubman in Harriet. Overall, the nominations for the 92nd Oscars favored a variety of older white men — like directors Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino — while largely ignoring some of the most acclaimed and diverse productions, such as the American-Chinese comedy The Farewell, which was neither nominated for best picture nor for any of its actors, including star Awkwafina.
The film with the most Oscar selections at 11 was Joker, which was directed by Todd Phillips and starred Joaquin Phoenix, who was nominated for best actor. The next three top films, all with 10 nominations each, also were made by and starred white men: Scorsese's The Irishman, Tarantino's Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood and Sam Mendes' 1917.
Following a 2012 report in the Los Angeles Times showing that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences looked like a 1950s country club (94% Caucasian, median age 62, 77% male), and several years of nominees and winners so monochromatic the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite became fitting, the Academy aggressively expanded its membership to include hundreds of younger voters from more diverse backgrounds.
But the impact of that demographic shift is largely invisible in this year's Academy Award shortlist, outside of strong support for the Korean class warfare drama, Parasite, which was nominated for best picture and director Bong Joon Ho. Tellingly, not a single member of the cast of Parasite or The Farewell was named in any acting category, even though many Oscar prognosticators had guessed several would be. Among the other non-white actors who were expected to — but ultimately did not receive — a nomination: Jennifer Lopez from Hustlers, Jamie Foxx from Just Mercy, and Lupita Nyong'o from Jordan Peele's Us. Even Beyoncé was left out of the Oscars for the song, ""Spirit,"" from The Lion King.
The nine best picture selections (there can be as many as 10) were The Irishman, Ford v Ferrari, JoJo Rabbit, Joker, Little Women, Marriage Story, 1917, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood and Parasite. If it wins the best picture award, Parasite will become the first foreign language movie to do so.
Netflix continued to build its influence in Hollywood with 24 nominations, including best picture nominees The Irishman (10) and Marriage Story (six), and even a best documentary feature nomination for American Factory, from Barack and Michelle Obama's production company.
The Oscars will be presented Feb. 9.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",John Horn,N73DBEX4MRGYFLMAVHRYEMDVKI,1

He was 41 years old.
Bryant was among nine people who died in the crash. Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl told KPCC/LAist that Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, was aboard the helicopter and also died.
Los Angeles Fire Chief Daryl Osby said emergency responders arriving at the crash scene discoved a debris field in steep terrain and a half-acre brush fire. Osby said firefighters hiked in with rescue equipment but found no survivors. Earlier in the day, there were news reports that five people were killed in the crash. At a news conference Sunday afternoon, L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said eight passengers and the pilot were on the flight manifest for the Sikorksy S-76B.
Villanueva refused to comment on the identities of those on board and was sharply critical of news reports — specifically citing TMZ, which was the first to report that Bryant was on the helicopter that crashed.
Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner officials said Sunday their investigators were at the scene ""recovering the bodies of the people who died in the crash.""
""Additionally, investigators are working on confirming the identities of the helicopter occupants,"" according to a release on the department's website. ""Their names will be released following official verification and notification to their next of kin.""
L.A. County's Medical Examiner-Coroner, Dr. Jonathan R. Lucas, said at a Sunday night news conference that he expected that process to take days.
But as hours passed on Sunday, the names of some of the other passengers were shared by colleagues and friends.
THE PASSENGERS
Bryant's daughter, Gianna, was an up-and-coming player in her own right. She played with the Los Angeles Lady Mambas, which was coached by Bryant and is part of a co-ed youth basketball league he created in partnership with the Los Angeles Boys and Girls Club. The team plays at Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, where the group was heading Sunday morning for a tournament.

Gianna, also known as Gigi, recently posted an Instagram video of herself in action. Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa confirmed that its head baseball coach, John Altobelli, died in the crash. Later, college officials said Altobelli's wife, Keri, and his daughter, Alyssa, were also aboard the helicopter and killed. Alyssa Altobelli was a teammate of Gianna Bryant's on the Los Angeles Lady Mambas, a girls' team coached by Kobe Bryant.
""John meant so much to not only Orange Coast College, but to baseball,"" Orange Coast College Athletic Director Jason Kehler said in a statement. ""He truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach. The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none — he treated them like family. Our deepest condolences go out to the Altobelli family during this time of tragedy."" Costa Mesa Mayor Katrina Foley said on Twitter that she had learned Christina Mauser was among those killed in the crash. Foley said Mauser was a coach and the wife of Matt Mauser, lead singer for the Tijuana Dogs, a popular Orange County band. Matt Mauser had been scheduled to perform at the Brea Imrov Sunday evening.
The venue called off the show, saying: ""Due to unforeseen circumstances, this event has been cancelled.""
THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE
Osby said the Fire Department received a call at 9:45 a.m. reporting a helicopter down and a brushfire in the hills above Los Virgenes Road near Willow Glen Street. Osby said it took about nine minutes for firefighters to hike extremely steep terrain to the site. Other firefighers were lowered to the scene from a sheriff's helicopter after the initial responders reported the presence of magnesium from the crash — magnesium can react explosively when it comes into contact with oxygen and water.
THE SCENE AND INVESTIGATION
In a Sunday evening news conference, Villanueva laid out the next steps in the investigation, saying it would be an ""extensive process, its going to take not just days but weeks to recover from this.""
He said the Federal Aviation Administration had established a five-mile perimeter around the crash site. He called the scene ""a logistical nightmare"" due to a combination of the crash site being hard to access and the swell of people trying to make their way to the scene.
""We have to reiterate, it is off-limits to everybody except the first responders and the investigators,"" said Villanueva, who warned the area had steep terrain that made it dangerous even in daylight.
He said road closures were in effect and identification would be required of local residents trying to access the area. The closures, until further notice, are:
Las Virgenes Road, between Agoura Road and Lost Hills Road.
North and southbound exits to 101 at Las Virgenes Roads
He directed community members who want to express condolences to De Anza Park in Calabasas.
The cause of the crash was not immediately known. The National Transportation Safety Board said they expected to have a investigators on site in Calabasas by Sunday evening.
Weather may play a role in the inquiry. The Los Angeles Times reported that thick fog in the region Sunday morning prompted the LAPD to ground its helicopters and the L.A. County Sheriff's Dept. also did not have helicopters in the air because of weather conditions.
In the last decade, according to the NTSB's database of accidents, Sikorsky-made helicopters have been involved in 11 fatal incidents worldwide that killed a total of 48 people. Four of those incidents took place in the U.S. The highest previous fatality toll — 14 — came in a 2012 crash of a different model Sikorsky helicopter. That aircraft, a Sikorsky S-58, disappeared over the Andes in Peru in a region with heavy cloud cover before searchers discovered the wreckage in a remote site.
""We extend our sincerest condolences to all those affected by today's Sikorsky S-76B accident in Calabasas, California,"" Sikorsky officials said in a tweet sent Sunday. ""We have been in contact with the NTSB and stand ready to provide assistance and support to the investigative authorities and our customer.""
THE REACTION
Twitter and other social media were overwhelmed by reactions to Bryant's death. The Lakers, who lost in Philadelphia on Saturday night, returned to Los Angeles on Sunday. Television news coverage showed videos of players arriving at LAX hugging their teammates and other officials.

He made the announcement during a stop in L.A. on his statewide homelessness tour, which kicked off earlier this week.
Newsom visited a board and care home (also called a residential care facility or group home) in central L.A.
Board and care homes house adults who need care, such as mental health issues, but don't need skilled nursing services. They can be a refuge for people on the verge of homelessness.
But these homes are rapidly closing across the state, and especially in Los Angeles County. Why?
Reimbursement rates from the state haven't kept up with costs.
High demand for L.A. real estate can lure building owners toward higher-value uses.
In the last three years, 39 board and care homes closed across the county, according to the California Community Care Licensing Division.
In December, county lawmakers and advocates for the homeless asked Newsom for $500 million of the state's new budget to preserve board and care homes.
Newsom appeared to have been listening.
""We no longer can assume that a city, even as large as L.A., even as extraordinarily large as L.A. County can do this alone,"" Newsom said Tuesday.
The governor's proposed budget for the coming fiscal year includes more than $1 billion to tackle homelessness. Of that, $750 million was put towards a new California Access to Housing and Service Fund, which will be used, in part, to stabilize board and cares.

On Friday, Secretary of State Alex Padilla granted conditional certification to the Voting Solutions for All People 2.0 system, including new 'ballot marking devices' that the county designed and built from the ground up. It's making history as the first publicly owned voting system in the U.S. to be certified for widespread use.
But the county must meet a stack of requirements before primary election voters get their hands on the machines starting Feb. 22.

""Elections officials have a duty to make voting both as secure and as accessible as possible,"" Padilla said in a press release. ""As part of my certification of VSAP, I am insisting on some essential modifications to the system and requiring on-going reports from Los Angeles County so that we can continue to improve the voting experience for Angelenos.""
The headline? In a reversal of the county's plans, voters must be given the option to hand-mark paper ballots at new voting centers. (You can find the one closest to you here.)
The mandate flies in the face of L.A.'s 10-year goal: to create a fully accessible voting experience where everyone, regardless of physical limitations or language abilities, votes the same way. 
Jurisdictions that use ballot marking devices generally offer a mixed system: voters have the option to use a machine to make selections and print a paper ballot, or hand-mark their ballot instead.
But L.A. County Registrar-Recorder Dean Logan has likened this blended model to creating ""a separate but equal type of scenario."" And there are several high-profile cases of jurisdictions — like the states of Georgia and South Carolina — switching to the all-machine approach in 2020.
Many election security experts argue that hand-marked ballots are the only sure inoculation against election hacking or tampering.
VOTING IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. SO WHAT'S NEXT?
It's not yet clear what the ""blank write-in paper ballots"" Padilla required in his certification decision will look like — that's up to L.A. County. They must ""contain all elements consistent with the Federal Voting Assistance Program's federal write-in absentee ballot,"" according to the Secretary of State.
[Check out the Federal Voting Assistance Program's ballot here. It's pretty much a blank slate with spaces to write in presidential, statewide and local candidates.]
""Voters may have to hand write candidates' names,"" Padilla's office said in a press release. ""[B]ut these ballots provide an opportunity for voters to hand mark their ballot if that is their preference.""
More takeaways from the 35 conditions included in Padilla's certification announcement:
Los Angeles has to address paper jams and misfeeds — which testing showed was happening nearly 5-times more than allowed by CA standards — through training and messaging for voters and election workers

All physical ballot boxes must have 'Secretary of State approved tamper evident...seals' on the seams between voting machine printers and ballot boxes

The county will tighten password security, add USB port covers at workstations with tamper-evident seals, submit a plan within 6 months to get to full disk encryption, and bring cryptographic modules up to a certain standard validation

The state is requiring detailed reporting on election worker training and records of all machine errors or paper jams that happen during the primary election
There is no substantial change mandated for the design of the ""MORE"" button that lets voters see candidates listed past the first digital 'page' on the ballot marking machines — a feature that's now the subject of a lawsuit by Beverly Hills. 
LA County must review the 'MORE' button, however, and do more education and outreach to make sure voters and election workers know how to see all candidates on the ballot.
The Registrar-Recorder's office says the certification conditions were all ""openly discussed"" by the county to address the results of independent testing.
""It is appropriate and expected that the VSAP system would undergo unprecedented review and testing,"" said Logan in a press release. LAist requested an interview with Logan for this story. The county declined, citing scheduling conflicts. Logan responded to some of our reporting on Twitter.

2020-01-30T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/30/cal-state-admissions-math-requirements.php,"To Get Into A Cal State, You Won't Need More High School Math â€” Yet: LAist","A controversial proposal to require high school students to take an extra year of math or a related class, like personal finance or coding, to be considered for admission to the Cal State University system is on hold.
Opponents of the plan have said it would discriminate against low-income students and students of color. The CSU board of trustees had been previously scheduled to vote on whether to authorize it at its meeting on Wednesday. Instead, they decided to wait for the results of a year-long independent study of the plan.
WHAT IS THE PLAN?
Those following the controversy closely may know the plan by its former name: the CSU Quantitative Reasoning Proposal.
Education advocates had long argued that the proposal would shut out students from schools that don't have the resources to add a fourth year of math or related courses. They are applauding the trustees' order for further study.
""We are encouraged that the Chancellor listened to our concerns that a shift in the admissions policy could have made it more difficult for students of color and low-income students to enter CSU,"" said Elisha Smith Arrillaga, executive director of Education Trust-West, in a statement. ""The proposed analysis is a positive step to ensure educational equity.""
HOW THE STUDY WILL WORK
The study will last a year and be conducted by a yet-to-be-named independent research group. Then, the trustees will review the study. Assuming it's completed on time, they'll vote in 2022 on whether to require stricter ""quantitative reasoning"" standards.
A yes vote would require incoming students to have finished more advanced classes in math or disciplines that require good math skills. Supporters of such requirements say that would better prepare incoming freshmen for college-level courses.
WHAT CLASSES WOULD QUALIFY?
Here are some of the classes CSU says could meet the new requirement:
Engineering
Forensics
Veterinary Science
Sports Medicine
Environmental Science
Statistics
Economics
Personal Finance
Accounting
Computer Science
Robotics
Programming
Coding
Game Design
THE COUNTER VIEW
Opponents say the burden to create and staff these classes would fall on California public school districts. And they say that's an issue.
L.A. Unified, the state's largest school district, says fewer than half of its graduates qualify to apply to Cal State under the current three-year math requirement. The school district, along with districts in Santa Ana, Anaheim, San Francisco, Sacramento, and others, are opposing the Cal State proposal.
California State University has argued that the change wouldn't be such a big push because nearly 80% of its incoming freshmen already have a fourth year of math or a quantitative reasoning class under their belt. Trustees point to Long Beach Unified as a model district for the change. Long Beach high schools already require graduates to take a fourth year of math or a class with math skills.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Adolfo Guzman-lopez,RFDIUWUOKZFVBEVPQYOTUJUBAA,1

Looking statewide, California isn't faring worse this flu season than it has in years past — so far.
""Right now things are looking like similar to what we have seen in usual flu seasons,"" said Dr. James Watt, chief of the division of communicable disease control with the California Department of Public Health.
But that's not the case in Los Angeles County, which is ""experiencing high levels of influenza activity,"" according to an advisory issued Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Flu is turning up at a rate higher than the peak of all but one of the last five influenza seasons, according to the county's most recent ""Influenza Watch"" update.
That's also the case for the rate of ER visits for influenza-like illnesses in the county. The only recent season that saw a higher rate for flu and ER visits was the 2017-18 season, which was particularly severe.
While the statewide situation is not cause for alarm, we are still in the middle of flu season, so the disease ""is circulating widely throughout the state right now,"" Watt said.
The state says there have been 70 influenza-related deaths in California since September.
So far, the main culprits nationally are the B/Victoria and A(H1N1) strains and that's true in California, too. The B strains are more likely to affect children, while A(H1N1) primarily impacts older folks.
Doctors say this season's flu vaccine is mostly effective against the strains that are circulating, although it's not clear yet if the vaccine will prove successful at fighting certain substrains of the B/Victoria virus.
""There are a couple different substrains of that [B/Victoria] virus that are circulating,"" said Watt. ""Some of those substrains are very similar to what's in the vaccine, some of them appear to be a little bit different, but we don't know yet whether that difference will translate into any reduced effectiveness of the vaccine.""
THERE'S STILL TIME FOR A FLU SHOT
Doctors and health officials say there's still time to get a flu shot; they recommend vaccination for anyone older than six months.
Neha Nanda, hospital epidemiologist with Keck Medicine of USC, is urging her patients to get vaccinated — not just for themselves — but for the greater good.
""Because if we reach a certain threshold of herd immunity, our immunocompromised group — our transplant patients, our stem cell transplant patients — they are at a lower risk for influenza,"" she said.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Robert Garrova,E3PBBEHESVG3NGLG2IRGLJJQ64,1
2020-01-24T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/24/how_to_shop_a_chinese_supermarket_like_a_pro.php,How To Shop A Chinese Supermarket Like A Pro: LAist,"Given that so much of Chinese culture is centered around food, it makes sense that our supermarkets are more than mere stores, they're cultural hubs.
In addition to cans of Cambell's soup and boxes of Frosted Flakes, Chinese grocery stores typically boast aisles stocked with dried noodles, freezer cases filled with fish balls and sections dedicated to plastic stools, incense and red envelopes. But the choices are vast and they can be overwhelming. Where do you start? In the San Gabriel Valley, the heart of Los Angeles's Chinese community, at a popular chain such as 99 Ranch, 168 Market and Shun Fat. Here's your basic shopping list. EGGS
Chinese supermarkets aren't the place to get organic, free range, omega 3-fortified eggs. Instead, the selection at a Chinese supermarket typically goes beyond basic chicken to include duck, quail and goose eggs. Some are raw, others are cooked or preserved. Pí Dàn, or century egg, an egg that has been preserved in a mixture of salt, lime, clay and ash until it turns black, may look unappetizing but it's delicious when sliced and served alongside a bowl of porridge. Balut, an egg dish that originated in China but is now a shared delicacy throughout Asia, is a half-developed egg embryo still in its shell. These items will sit next to the ""regular"" eggs in the fridge but you'll occasionally find them next to the cashier as you check out. BLACK FUNGUS
In the dried herb aisle, look for an area with dried mushrooms in vacuum sealed packages. Large markets carry many kinds of mushrooms. Many, many kinds of mushrooms. ""Black fungus,"" despite its unappealing name, is a good place to start. It's frequently used in dishes like vegetable stir fries and hot and sour soup as well as in medicinal preparations. It's sold dry and rehydrated during the cooking process when it turns into an edible jelly with a faint crunch. Black fungus doesn't have much flavor. Instead, it acts as a sponge, absorbing the flavor of whatever it's prepared with. It's the perfect quick addition to a salad, and you'll often see it in wood ear and cucumber salads. TEA
Any respectable Chinese supermarket will have multiple sections dedicated to tea. Some even have a dedicated tea counter staffed full-time by its own clerk. Served with every meal, tea was once considered a status symbol and it remains a staple in Chinese culture. There are six basic types: green, white, yellow, oolong, black and dark. Each is processed in its own way, has a unique flavor profile and supposedly confers unique health benefits. While preparing and serving tea can be an art, you don't need to be a connoisseur to enjoy it. A great starter tea, especially if you've spent most of your life drinking the bagged stuff, is Sunflower's jasmine tea. The orange and gold tin of loose leaf tea is a classic in Chinese households and restaurants. The branchlike leaves give off a soft, floral scent and pair well with a meal of dim sum. Yamamotoyama's bags of sencha green tea have an earthy, slightly nutty taste and they're packaged in a simple, bright green box. If you're looking for a tea with a more complicated flavor, try Wong Lo Kat's herbal tea drink, which is sweet and earthy. Most supermarkets will sell this as a drink in its iconic red and black can, but sometimes you can find it as a small white bag of leaves and herbs you can brew at home. BREAD
Many Chinese supermarkets boast in-house bakeries and they generally make bread that's much better than what you'll find in the aisles — especially if you score it fresh from the oven. The loaves have a soft, pillowy texture, and they're perfect when toasted, swiped with butter and served with coffee. These bakeries don't stick to plain bread. They play with textures and ingredients to offer a menu of sweet and savory options. Grab a taro roll, a small bun with a slight purple tint that's stuffed with taro, or a round of custard bread, a golden pastry filled with egg custard. If you're not looking for dessert, try a hotdog encased in flaky pastry dough and flecked with green onions or a maybe a roll baked with mushrooms, bacon and a layer of cheese. SOUP BASES
Chinese cuisine features a variety of soups with long lists of ingredients ingredients, complicated flavors and recipes that demand hours of cooking. To shorten that process, markets offer bases for wonton noodle soup, egg drop soup, oxtail soup and other classics. These bases can come in packets of spices or canisters of loose powder. You'll also find soup bases specifically for hot pots. They include mellow mushroom, pork bone and spicy flavors. Add ingredients like vegetables, seafood, dried noodles and raw meat to make it your own and eat communally. MSG
Monosodium glutamate, commonly known as MSG, is a chemical compound that enhances the taste of food. Discovered in the early 1900s by a Japanese biochemist who was trying to duplicate the flavor of edible seaweed, it got a bad rap when people started claiming it caused headaches, nausea and cancer. The science is clear. MSG doesn't cause any of those things but the racism driving the demonization of MSG is very real. The flavor enhancer is common in Chinese cooking and you can find bags of it in the spice aisle of most Chinese markets. It compliments savory, salty and spicy flavors, adding a layer of umami. That's why you often find it in chips, canned soups, deli meat and many other prepared foods. The compound also occurs naturally in foods like mushrooms, tomatoes and cheese. BITTERMELON
Bittermelon, which looks sort of like a cucumber, is one of the most unique vegetables you'll find. What differentiates this bitter gourd from its better known cousin is its rough and bumpy skin. As its name implies, this vegetable tastes bitter and people rarely eat it raw, on its own. It's usually stir-fried or served in soup to compliment salty and savory flavors. Chinese people also swear by its health properties. It supposedly strengthens your immune system, boosts your liver health and improves your eyesight. Ask Chinese adults how they feel about bittermelon and many will tell you how they were forced to eat it as a child for the sake of health so now they're used to the sharp taste. DRAGON FRUIT
In Chinese, huǒ lóng guǒ directly translates as ""fire dragon fruit."" People appreciate the beautiful cactus fruit for its bold pink and green color, its spiky shape and the dotted black and white pattern when it's cut open. Although it stands out in any fruit bowl, it has a subdued flavor. Dragon fruit is subtly sweet, like a cross between a pear and kiwi. It's usually sliced and served raw. Dragon fruit can also be made into a jam or incorporated into baked goods, particularly during the fall around the harvest moon festival when it's baked into mooncakes. PEANUTS
In a Chinese supermarket, peanuts aren't sold in the snack aisle. You'll usually find bags of raw, fresh peanuts next to the produce. They can be enjoyed as they are but it's traditional to boil them in water with different spices, such as cinnamon and star anise. Some markets will also sell pre-roasted peanuts or flavored ones they make themselves (garlic and chili is a common combo). They make a great snack or pre-meal appetizer. Fresh peanuts let you enjoy the legume's natural flavor and you can cook them according to your own tastes. SHACHA SAUCE
Shacha sauce is used as often as soy sauce or chili oil in Chinese cooking but it doesn't get the same recognition. Also known as satay sauce or Chinese barbeque sauce, it's a thick, savory paste with a spicy kick. Its richness comes from the combo of soybean oil, garlic, chilis, brill fish and dried shrimp. You'll find it in the condiment section, next to the hot pot broth bases. Shacha and hot pot go hand-in-hand as it's a popular dipping sauce used throughout the meal. It's not just a condiment. Shacha is a key ingredient in many Chinese dishes including braised chicken and beef chow mein. It can also be used as a base for soups, a barbecue rub or a seasoning in stir fries. CANNED CONGEE
Congee is a rice porridge and it's served in several Asian cuisines. The canned version is a breakfast staple for many Chinese families but it can be served any time of day. It's also a great on-the-go snack. Plain congee is bland so the canned stuff is always mixed with other flavors such as red bean, taro or yams. You can top it with brown sugar and red bean, peanuts and milk, and mung bean and longans, that are worth trying. Look out for cans of eight treasure congee, or bā bǎo zhōu, a traditional porridge made with sticky rice and eight different kinds of beans and nuts. GÀI LǍN
When you need your daily dose of greens, consider trading spinach or kale for gài lǎn. The green vegetable, also known as Chinese broccoli, has a thick stalk that thins out into long, flat leaves at the top. When left raw, it can be very tough and bitter. Cooked gài lǎn offers a balance of textures between the crunch and tenderness of the stalk and the soft, chewiness of the leaves. The classic preparation of the vegetable is either steamed or boiled with oyster sauce drizzled on top. It's typically served as a side dish. HAW FLAKES
This popular Chinese candy made from hawthorn fruit and sugar has a sweet, tart and almost tangy taste, similar to a Fruit Roll-Up. Parents have been known to give their children haw flakes when they're sick to drown out the taste of medicine. If you don't find any haw flakes in the snack and candy sections, you might see them in the aisle for medicine and herbs. Keep an eye out for the red, pink and yellow packaging. Aside from the flavor, what makes this candy so great is its shape. Haw flakes are typically thin, flat disks that are stacked to form a small cylinder, which you can break apart and pop in your mouth. They come in packs of ten, but that might not be enough. LAP CHEUNG
Lap cheung (aka Chinese sausage), pronounced là cháng, translates to dried sausage. At its most basic, it's made with pork, salt, soy sauce, sugar, spices and alcohol then left to dry in the sun. Chinese supermarkets offer lap cheung in an array of meats and flavors. You'll find sausages mixed with duck liver, rice and pork blood. Lap cheung tastes sweeter than Italian sausage and is typically used as a flavor component in dishes. Lap cheung is often used in stir fries, fried rice and turnip cakes. If you want a quick and delicious meal, slice the sausage, throw it on the frying pan and enjoy it over a bowl of rice with a side of sliced, raw garlic.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Sabrina Fang,437W35XDDFHXJGDBP6LKP6UEWM,1
2020-01-10T00:00:00Z,https://www.laist.com/2020/01/10/st-vincent-medical-center-hospital-closing-bankruptcy.php,One Of LA's Oldest Hospitals Is Closing: LAist,"St. Vincent Medical Center, near downtown Los Angeles, will be closing its doors.
The hospital's owner, Verity Health System, filed for bankruptcy in 2018. Since then, efforts to sell the facility have fallen through.
A bankruptcy judge on Wednesday approved Verity's request to close the hospital, which employs more than 1,000 people and has more than 350 beds.
WHAT'S NEXT
It's not clear exactly when the doors will close. Here's what we do know:
Doctors with offices on the premises have been given until the end of April to vacate.
Current St. Vincent patients will receive care until they're discharged or can be safely transferred to nearby hospitals.
The company also said that ambulance service will be diverted to ER's in the vicinity.
That will include the eight hospitals within a three-mile radius of St. Vincent.
The decision to close the hospital ""has not been taken lightly and comes only after exhausting every option to keep this hospital open,"" Verity CEO Rich Adcock said in a statement.
""While we regret the closure of St. Vincent, we know that this community will continue to be well-served by nearby hospitals,"" he said.
THE BACKSTORY
St. Vincent was opened in 1856 by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, an order of nuns that dates back to 17th century France. The hospital's website describes it as the ""oldest hospital in Los Angeles.""
WHAT ABOUT THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES?
It's also unclear how many of the more than 1,000 employees of the facility will lose their jobs. Verity said it will hold a job fair for staff affected by the closure.
California Nurses Association President Zenei Cortez said St. Vincent's nurses are ""seasoned and marketable,"" and should have no trouble finding new jobs.
CNA opposed the closure; it argued that a shutdown would deprive the area of a needed source of health care.
""St. Vincent is not a retail store, where they can just decide to close down the next day,"" said Christine Chung, a registered nurse who's worked at the hospital for more than 13 years.
""It is a hospital that has responsibility and accountability to the community to provide the services it needs,"" she said.
The CNA also argued that Verity was violating a state law that requires hospitals to notify the public 90 days before the closure of a facility that has emergency services.
WHAT ABOUT THE DOCTORS' OFFICES?
Ten physicians at St. Vincent wrote a letter asking bankruptcy court Judge Ernest Robles to extend the deadline for them to close their offices from March 31 to June 30.
The letter said the doctors received notice of the impending closure on January 6. ""The unrealistic notice does not give us time to properly notify or transfer patients to other physicians for care,"" it said.
Robles ended up giving them until April 30.","-117.1445,35.1478,-119.1445,33.1478",Robert Garrova,ROGW5SUXOJHNNE4MOBWHDLGI3I,1

However, museum-goers should be aware that they'll still have to pay for parking. And SoCal Museums notes that the offer only applies to general admission and not to specially ticketed exhibitions.

6:05 p.m.: This article was updated with information from the National Transportation Safety Board's Tuesday afternoon news conference.
This article was originally published at 2:15 p.m.
Federal safety investigators said Tuesday the helicopter that was carrying Kobe Bryant and eight others was in ""steep descent"" before it crashed, and that the helicopter lacked an onboard safety net system that investigators had previously recommended be required for all similar aircraft.
Investigators said they will issue a preliminary report on Sunday's accident in 10 days, but the final report outlining the probable cause of the crash could take up to 18 months.
Here's what we know about the flight so far:
""STEEP DESCENT""
The helicopter was 2,300 feet above sea level when it lost communication with air traffic control. It then descended rapidly, at a rate of over 2,000 feet per minute, National Transportation Safety Board member Jennifer Homendy said.
""So we know that this was a high energy impact crash,"" she said.
Investigators said the helicopter's impact site was about 20 to 30 feet below the top of the hill, but stressed there were also higher hills in the canyon.
TERRAIN AWARENESS WARNING SYSTEM
Homendy said there was no terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) on the helicopter. The NTSB had recommended in 2006 that all helicopters with capacity for six or more passengers be equipped with this type of warning system. The recommendation came after a 2004 helicopter accident near Galveston, Texas.
However, the Federal Aviation Administration did not implement the recommendation, Homendy said.
After investigating a helicopter crash in the Baltic Sea in 2005, the NTSB also recommended helicopters be equipped with a cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. But the FAA didn't accept that recommendation, either.
There was no ""black box"" on board, but investigators recovered an iPad and cell phone.
FLIGHT PATTERN
The helicopter left John Wayne Airport in Orange County shortly after 9 a.m. en route to a youth basketball tournament in Thousand Oaks. It traveled up the I-5 corridor before circling around the Burbank airport several times, waiting for air traffic controllers to clear it.
Once cleared, it continued northwest through the Van Nuys airspace and then west to follow the 101 corridor, crashing into a Calabasas hillside around 9:45 a.m.
The website Flightradar24 has an interactive map showing the flight's path. 'SPECIAL VISUAL FLIGHT RULES'
The pilot, who has been identified Ara Zoboyan, was given permission to fly through Burbank and Van Nuys' airspace, under what is known as ""special visual flight rules,"" a kind of clearance for flying in low visibility. John Cox, an aviation safety expert, told LAist special visual flight rules are requested by helicopter pilots pretty routinely because they can fly slower and closer to the ground.
Homendy from the NTSB also said it was ""very common"" to fly under special visual flight rules.
The LAPD had grounded its helicopters Sunday morning because of low visibility, according to spokesman Josh Rubenstein. But Homendy said that's not an indication that conditions were unsafe for other helicopters to be flying, calling it an ""apples to oranges"" comparison. ""Different helicopter, different operations,"" she said.
Investigators have yet to determine how much weather was a factor in the crash. Tom Anthony, director of the USC Aviation Safety and Security Program, says pilots can get disoriented in heavy fog.
""When you're in a cloud, you can lose spatial orientation,"" Anthony said. ""Low clouds, low ceilings and lack of visibility, mountain obscuration, are all adverse weather conditions for flight.""
'FLIGHT FOLLOWING'
After the pilot left the Van Nuys airspace, he asked an air traffic controller for what's known as ""flight following."" This means navigation help from the control tower to help cope with the low visibility. An air traffic controller told the pilot that the helicopter was flying too low to register on the radar and therefore too low to offer flight following.
LAST COMMUNICATION
According to investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, the pilot told air traffic controllers that he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer shortly before the helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas.
The NTSB's Homendy said Zoboyan had a ""good amount of experience,"" with over 8,200 hours of flight time. The day before the accident, he flew from John Wayne to Camarillo, but the weather was clear and he took a more direct flight path, Homendy said.
THE HELICOPTER The helicopter was a Sikorsky 76-B, a luxury helicopter popular with VIPs but also used for search and rescue and utility missions, like transporting people to oil rigs. The NTSB has recorded 53 accidents since 1979 involving Sikorsky S-76 helicopters, 12 of them fatal. Aircraft experts say the model is considered very safe.
""It's a real workhorse of a helicopter,"" Peter Goelz, former managing director of the NTSB, told KPCC's AirTalk. ""It has a pretty good safety record.""
The helicopter was owned by a company called Island Express Holding Corp. and news outlets have reported that Bryant used the copter — and Zobayan as a pilot — on many occasions.
WHAT'S NEXT?
NTSB investigators finished their work at the crash site Tuesday and turned it over to local authorities, Homendy said. They have begun to interview air traffic controllers and other witnesses and will continue with interviews over the next few days, she said.
Whenever the NTSB issues its final report, Homendy said it could also recommend new safety measures with the goal of preventing a similar accident in the future.
